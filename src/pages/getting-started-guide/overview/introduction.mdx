  Welcome to the getting started guide! From here you can find project guidance, inspiration, and more to help you and your teams deliver getting started experiences.

## What's getting started?

Getting started experiences help users move to productive use, guide them through specific tasks, and showcase new features within a product.  

Getting started experiences provide users with: 

* The "Lay of the land" to help them navigate the UI with ease. 
* Way-finding, so that the user understands the objective or outcome and how to get there.
* Common pathways through the main tasks, to educate and highlight a product offering’s unique value.

## When to implement

You should create a getting started experience any time you want to help a user understand how to use the product or highlight a significant update. Getting started experiences should be tailored to your users and their specific needs. 

Building these experiences is all about balance, you need to show the user how to use the product but also showcase the product's unique value. As you're creating content, make sure your users can understand how the product facilitates their main goal rather than emphasizing individual features.

When it comes to getting started, less is more. First-time users should only see the top 1-3 flows, rather than all possible options. 

## Getting started with getting started

As part of the Cloud, Data and AI Pattern Asset Library, we will continue to add additional guidance and patterns. 

To start, we've pulled together tools and resources to help you prioritize getting started experiences within your project roadmaps. We've also provided guidance and patterns that you can use to build out two of the most common in-app tours within WalkMe: 

* [UI tours](/walkme-guide/overview/ui-tours) that point out specific parts of the UI and help orient new users or highlight new features
* [Step-by-step guides](/walkme-guide/overview/step-by-step-guides) that help a user complete a specific task 

To learn more about these tours and how to implement them visit the [WalkMe guide](/walkme-guide/overview).
