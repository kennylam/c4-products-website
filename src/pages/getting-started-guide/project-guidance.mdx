<PageDescription>

  Delivering a getting started experience can be an intensive project that requires people from multiple disciplines including Offering Managers, Developers, UX Designers, Content Designers and Visual Designers.

  In this section we will break down the steps it takes to go from zero to a fully implemented experience. (Note: Many of these steps can be done in parallel.)

## Prioritize

Like any project, before your start building you need to prioritize. There are a number of themes that you can consider when prioritizing the types of getting started experiences you want to deliver:

* Helping where users struggle the most in your experience
* Teaching fundamental product functions critical to completing tasks
* Pointing out the value of important features to the users
* Highlighting competitive differentiators 

We surveyed a number of IBMers and "Helping where users struggle the most in your experience" was the most important theme to address through getting started experiences. If you choose to follow that same pattern we suggest leaning on data and insights from user research to uncover those key pain points. And of course, don't prioritize alone. This is also a great time to align with your 3-in-a-box team.

## Design

### Style

Designing your getting started flows happens the same way as any other design project. That's why we suggest taking an iterative approach to your design, starting with low-fidelity prototypes or user flows and moving into more hi-fi prototypes that you can test with your users. Looking for specific style guidance? We've pulled together [resources](/getting-started-guide/resources) to help you get started.

### Writing

Content is an essential part of any getting started experience. There will be a lot of things that need to be described and making sure your content is clear, consistent, and concise is key.  We recommend following the our CD&AI Voice and Tone Guide as well as the content guidance for individual Walkme components and flows. Don't have a content designer? No problem. Just make sure you can identify at least one person to own the content, this could be your OM, a technical writer, or a word enthusiast.

## Install

### Segment

While you can install WalkMe without using Segment, we highly recommend deploying Walkme through Segment.

Segment is a single platform that collects, stores, and routes your user data (page visits, clicks, etc.) to tools of your choice with the flick of a switch.

* First, Segment needs to be installed on your product so it can track things like page visits, user clicks, etc.
* Then it can send that data to whatever source you want to use that data.
* When you view your usage stats in Amplitude you are viewing data provided by Segment.

Services like Amplitude are simply visualizing the data collected from Segment. WalkMe uses the data that Segment gathers to trigger shout-outs and other components to the right user at the right time. To request Segment access, please reach out to john.m.manion@ibm.com.

### Walk Me

The importance of installing Segment is that you can use it to easily install WalkMe. By adding the WalkMe destination to your offering's source in Segment's UI, Segment can automatically load WalkMe's script on every page that contains Segment instrumentation without any changes or manipulation to your offering's code base.

#### Why injecting WalkMe via Segment is recommended:

* Centralized Management of WalkMe Snippet * Toggle WalkMe on/off without dependency on development cycles
* Seamless Data Integration * Aggregate WalkMe events, offering events/milestones, and server-side events (e.g. SSM) in Segment while maintaining a consistent user ID (through IBM ID)
* Data Privacy Compliance * Leverage clients’ global cookie preferences through Segment's TrustArc integration to deploy WalkMe in a compliant manner (required vs. functional cookies)
 
#### Direct injections of WalkMe snippet

If installing Segment isn't an option for your product you can also install WalkMe directly using a code snippet that can be inserted into every part of they UI that needs WalkMe.

## Build

Once you've designed your flows you can start building the experiences. The WalkMe experiences can be built in the tool's no-code editor. WalkMe has a lot of training to help you get up to speed. To get access to that training, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [WalkMe University sign-up page](https://walkme.litmos.com/self-signup)
2. Input your name and email
3. Input our access code: WMU0719-pcx8jnm3
4. Upon submission, check your email for an automated email containing your instant access link

All IBMers who will be building and publishing WalkMe content should complete the DAP Fundamentals and the DAP Builder Courses.

Note: Currently, there's a problem with SVGs used for focus and hover states for On-Prem environments. The growth team is working on a fix and we will update guidance accordingly.

### Test

Even though you can build the WalkMe flows without WalkMe being installed on the product, you won't be able to test it until you do.

WalkMe has the ability to preview your flows in its builder interface but we have run into instances where something might work in the preview but it doesn't work on the actual live environment. We suggest having a fully functioning and up-to-date testing environment where you can publish the flows without end users running into incomplete flows.

We also recommend testing the flows with your Sponsor Users or IBMers who aren't familiar with your product to make sure your content makes sense and the flows are functioning correctly.

## Review

Reviews within each team will be happening multiple times during this process. The formal review will be handled by the DUX reviews and their Getting started quality dimension. Currently the Getting Started experiences are measured on the following factors:

#### User Needs

* Install, deploy, and set up solutions
* Engage with initial experience
* Prove quick value

#### Heuristics

* Is there a clear getting started flow or guided tour for new users?
* Can first time and novice users understand how to get started with the solution?
* Are new concepts and terminology explained in plain language to facilitate getting started?

## Launch

If you were able to test things out on a testing environment then your Walkme flows are technically already live so all you have to do is change the targeting to the live environments/URLs. The main thing that will affect launching a WalkMe tour will be if you're publishing to a Cloud or an on-prem product.

For Cloud, you can essentially publish whenever and you don't have to align with any development schedule. For on-prem products,  you will have to align your building/testing/launching with the release schedule.

    >
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

### Maintain

After WalkMe flows are launched there may be a couple of instances where the flows that were built need to be continuously updated. Worst case scenario, the flows start breaking on the live environment which means you'll want to regularly check the flows so your customers aren't the first ones to notice problems.  Additionally, new UI elements can break WalkMe flows so make sure you build in the time to update the flows in addition to any product updates.

      actionIcon="launch"

    >
    </ResourceCard>
  </Column>
</Row>

### Refine

Finally, when you are ready to iterate on your flows there are a number of ways that you can get data on how they are performing. First, there's the traditional route of gathering usability data via user research studies. Additionally there are two ways that you can view the usage data from the WalkMe flows:

**Option 1:** Use Amplitude to view the Segment data
**Option 2:** Review the built-in WalkMe analytics.
