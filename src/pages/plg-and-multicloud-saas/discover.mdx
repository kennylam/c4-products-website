When people look for solutions for their business needs, research shows that they tend to rely on the following discovery touch points: 
- Search results in common search engine (such as Google) and in the hyperscaler marketplaces
- Analyst reports
- Customer reviews and recommendations
- Social media influencers

Understanding the key problems that a product helps to solve brings alignment to the potential customer’s intent. Making sure our offerings are discoverable, recognizable and stand out amongst others in the marketplace search results is important as it is the first touchpoint the user has in their journey with IBM products.
