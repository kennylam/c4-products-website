## Introduction

If you’re looking to extend or refresh your content skills, you’ve come to the right place!
This page provides a series of bite-sized education videos that have been put together by our [content design team](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/practices/content-design/our-team).
Each one covers a different aspect of content design best practice and is short enough to watch over a coffee break. Enjoy! ☕️

#### Getting the embedded videos to load
- The videos are hosted internally and require authentication.  
- In one of the "Email Verification" panels below, enter your IBM email address, click <strong>GET ACCESS</strong>,
