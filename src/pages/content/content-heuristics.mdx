## Overview
The following content heuristics are provided to help IBM Cloud & Cognitive design teams develop engaging, 
user-centered content that is professional, consistent, and which helps our clients succeed. We've split 
out the individual heuristics into three logical sections. 

Note that this same set of heuristics is also used to assess the **Content & Get Help** quality dimension 
of our product [D&UX program](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/dux/) reviews (although not all 
heuristics will necessarily be applicable to all products).


## 1) Appropriate content to help users succeed
Based on a thorough understanding of the target user and what their goals are, content is provided 
that is appropriate to the user's level of expertise, that helps them achieve their goals, and that 
uses terminology that is meaningful to them.

| # | Heuristic | Related links |
| - | --------- | ------------- |
| 1a | Content is pitched at an appropriate level for the target audience. | |
| 1b | Terminology is appropriate to the target audience, is intuitive, and is used consistently throughout the experience. Technical and business jargon is avoided. | > <Link to="/content/content-principles#use-simple-terms">Use simple terms</Link><br/>> <Link to="/content/language-and-grammar#use-simple-verb-forms">Use simple verb forms</Link><br/>> <Link to="/content/language-and-grammar#avoid-jargon">Avoid jargon</Link><br/>> <Link to="/content/terminology/approved-terms">Terminology</Link> |
| 1c | Where relevant, concepts, labels, features, and processes are defined and explained in context. | |
| 1d | Is it always clear to the user where they are within the product and how they can navigate to other parts of the product UI. | > <Link to="/content/ia">Information architecture</Link> |
| 1e | UI text is predominantly in the active (not passive) voice and is action-orientated. It is focused on helping users achieve their goals (not merely on describing features or technology). | > <Link to="/content/language-and-grammar/#use-the-active-voice">Use the active voice</Link><br/>> <Link to="/content/content-principles#focus-on-user-action">Focus on user action</Link> |
| 1f | Warning messages alert users to the consequences of any unrecoverable actions before they are committed. | > `coming soon` |
| 1g | Error messages are clear, avoid blame, and help users get back on track. | > `coming soon` |


## 2) Formatting and style
Content is well structured and is formatted in accordance with our style guidelines — and therefore is consistent with other IBM Cloud & Cognitive portfolio products.

| # | Heuristic | Related links |
| - | --------- | ------------- |
| 2a | UI text is clear, concise, and follows our content guidelines. | > <Link to="/content/overview/overview">Content guide</Link> |
| 2b | Where relevant, headings, subheadings, tabs, bullet-point lists, field labels, and so on are used to break up content and to help users quickly scan the page. | > <Link to="/content/ia#headings-and-subheadings">Headings and subheadings</Link><br/>> <Link to="/content/ia#methods-for-organizing-content-within-a-page">Methods for organizing content within a page</Link> |
| 2c | UI body text is comfortable to read (for example, at full screen, text line lengths are between 32-80 characters in length) | > <Link to="/content/content-principles#set-text-line-lengths">Set text line lengths</Link> |
| 2d | Navigation labels are concise (typically 1-3 words) and predominantly use nouns (not verbs). | > <Link to="/content/navigation-labels">Navigation labels</Link> |
| 2e | Navigation labels match page headings (or section headings) that they link to so that there is no disconnect for the user between the two. | > <Link to="/content/navigation-labels#match-link-text-to-page-heading">Match link text to page heading</Link> |
| 2f | Button labels are concise (typically 1-2 words) and where possible use standard Carbon action labels. | > [Carbon action labels](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/action-labels/) |
| 2g | Sentence case capitalization is used consistently throughout the UI. (The names of product features and components should **not** be capitalized unless they are sold separately or are trademarked.) | > <Link to="/content/capitalization">Capitalization</Link> |
| 2h | Where relevant, bold or italic formatting (not underlining) is used to emphasize important text. | > <Link to="/content/content-principles#use-appropriate-formatting">Use appropriate formatting</Link> |


## 3) Providing additional help
Users are guided through common user flows within the UI. While UI panels are kept streamlined, additional information is available to users who might want it.

| # | Heuristic | Related links |
| - | --------- | ------------- |
| 3a | Where relevant, contextual help is provided (for example, through tooltips, learning panels, WalkMe guides, and so on) so that users rarely need to navigate away from the product UI context. | > <Link to="../../walkme/overview/overview">WalkMe guide</Link> |
| 3b | Where relevant, tooltips are provided to help users identify icons, reveal details of truncated text, and to offer brief definitions and explanations of important labels and terms. | > `coming soon` |
| 3c | Where a subset of users might reasonably want access to more detailed information than can be offered in-context, appropriate links are provided (for example, to product docs, tutorials, videos, support communities, and so on) | |
| 3d | Product docs are well structured so that they are easy for users to navigate and to find what they are looking for. | |
| 3e | Individual doc pages are concise and clear and task instructions are easy to follow. | |
