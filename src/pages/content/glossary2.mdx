#### Overview
- With the move to Cloud Paks and Platforms, it's more important than ever that our offerings use terms in a consistent way.
- This glossary is aimed at designers and developers working on IBM Cloud & Cognitive offerings.
- It lists common UI terms used across our portfolio and provides usage guidance.
- It is **not** intended to be an exhaustive list.
- It's maintained by a subgroup of the Cloud & Cognitive **Design System Adoption Guild** (DSAG), chaired by [Tom Waterton](https://ibm-casdesign.slack.com/archives/D1ZKKC3CL).

#### Explanation of the Source of guidance column
- `Carbon` — these entries are copied directly from the Carbon <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/action-labels" target="_blank">Action labels<Launch16 fill="#0F62FE" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a> page. 
- `Carbon > C&C` — these entries originated from Carbon but have been modified to meet the needs of C&C offerings.
- `C&C` — these entries have been defined by the C&C Design org.

# **A**

### add
Takes an existing object and uses it in a new context (for example, adds an item to the cart, adds 
a user to a group, or adds a document to a folder).  
_Where appropriate, combine add with the object (for example, "add user" or "add role"). 
Compare [create](#create), [insert](#insert), [new](#new), and [upload](#upload)._

### apply
Saves changes without closing the dialog. These properties often affect subsequent system behavior.  
_Use instead of "Save changes". Compare [save](#save)._
<InlineNotification>
Note: There is an open issue ([here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/1276)) with the Carbon team about this current definition.
</InlineNotification>

### approve
Indicates the user agrees. In a business process, typically initiates the next step.  
_Compare [reject](#reject)._

### artificial intelligence (AI)
A system capable of simulating human intelligence and thought processes. Note that AI is a broad 
field of science that covers many sub-disciplines, including machine learning, visual recognition, 
and natural language processing.  
_The acronym AI is widely understood to refer to artificial intelligence, so do not use this same 
acronym to refer to [augmented intelligence](#augmented-intelligence)._

### assistant
An AI-driven agent with domain knowledge that assists a human user with a task. Assistants may take 
the form of a chatbot or some other interface.

### augmented intelligence
A similar term to artificial intelligence but with more of a focus on AI's assistive role, 
emphasizing the fact that cognitive technology is designed to enhance human intelligence rather than 
replace it.  
_Compare [artificial intelligence](#artificial-intelligence-ai)._


# **B**
_[Back to top](#)_

### back
Returns the user to the previous step in a sequence of steps, such as in a wizard.  
_Use instead of "previous". Compare [next](#next) and [finish](#finish)._

### browse
Assists the user in selecting a file (for example, on a button or link next to an entry field). 
Typically opens a secondary window where the user can locate and select the desired directory and 
file.


# **C**
_[Back to top](#)_

### cancel
Stops the current action and closes the dialog.  
Warn the user of any possible negative consequences of stopping an action from progressing, such as 
data corruption.  
_Compare [reset](#reset)._

### clear
This action clears all the fields or selections. Also deletes the contents of a document, such as a 
log. Typically the default selection or value is re-established for controls that always have a 
selection or value, such as radio buttons.  
_Where appropriate, combine clear with the object (for example, "clear fields" or "clear all"). 
Compare [delete](#delete) and [remove](#remove)._
<InlineNotification>
Note: There is an open issue ([here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/1277)) with the Carbon team about this current definition.
</InlineNotification>

### close
Closes the current page or window (for example, closing a secondary window containing online help).  
_Do not use close alongside OK or cancel actions. Compare [Cancel](#cancel) and [done](#done)._

### confidence score
In AI contexts, the predicted probability of an answer being correct. This is often a numerical 
expression of certainty shown as a percentage.

### copy
Creates new instances of the selected objects in a specific destination.  
Combine copy with the object being copied (for example, "copy folder") or the destination (for example, 
"copy to clipboard") if there are multiple possibilities.  
_Compare [new](#new)._

### create
Makes a new object from scratch (for example, creates a calendar event or creates a new document).  
_In scenarios where the user needs to supply some details or settings as part of the create process, 
use new to initiate the action and create to apply the user-supplied details or settings to the new 
object. Compare [add](#add), [copy](#copy), [insert](#insert), and [new](#new)._

### customize
Allow a user to make desired changes.
