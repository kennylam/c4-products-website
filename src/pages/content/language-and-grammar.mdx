## Use standard US English spelling

Quite a few English words are spelled differently in different parts of the world. However, in IBM
we always use US English spelling.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont text="The artifact is colored gray" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  <DoDont text="The artefact is coloured grey" type="dont" aspectRatio="1:1" />
</DoDontRow>

**Some examples:**

| ✅ Use standard US-English spellings | 🚫 Avoid non-US English spellings |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| authorize                           | authorise                         |
| behavior                            | behaviour                         |
| canceled                            | cancelled                         |
| center                              | centre                            |
| meter                               | metre                             |
| organize                            | organise                          |
| program                             | programme                         |
| toward                              | towards                           |

We can all make typos or forget how to spell a particular word, so always run your UI text through a 
spell checker (for example, paste your text into a blank Word document and ensure the dictionary is set to US English).

It’s also always worth getting someone else to review your copy before it gets published. If you don't 
have anyone on your product team who you can ask, do put a request out on the [#content_design_guild](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/CAKNY6LSV) 
Slack channel.

## Use contractions

Users don't want to read more characters than necessary and we want to present a conversational style.
So do use simple, commonly understood contractions such as _can't_, _don't_, _isn't_, and so on.

However, avoid complex contractions that involve combining more than two words (for example, do not write _wouldn't've_ or _shouldn't've_).

> Contractions: What's not to like?

## Use the active voice

In an active voice construction, the subject performs the action (for example, _Sarah publishes the application_).
In contrast, in a passive voice construction, the target of the action is emphasized (for example, _The application is published_).

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Product X scans files for viruses before uploading them to the web server."
      caption="Correct use of the active voice."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Files are scanned for viruses and, if cleared, uploaded to the web server."
      caption="Here it's not totally clear who or what scans the files."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

- In general, the active voice is preferable because it emphasizes action and progress.
- The active voice also makes clear who or what is performing the action, which can often be hidden in passive voice constructions.
- Sentences written in the active voice also tend to be shorter than those written in the passive voice.

#### Exception
Using the passive voice is occasionally useful though — such as when you want to avoid blaming the user:

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont text="Error: An incorrect value was entered" aspectRatio="1:1" />
</DoDontRow>


## Use simple verb forms

Wherever possible, use simple, single-word verb forms. This makes text easier to understand for all.

For example, avoid using verb phrases when the verb alone will suffice.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont text="Start the monitoring service" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  <DoDont text="Start up the monitoring service" type="dont" aspectRatio="1:1" />
</DoDontRow>

## Use the present tense

There are twelve major verb tenses in the English language, but thankfully, we rarely need to use 
most of these when writing text for our product UIs. In general, write using simple, present tense verbs.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont text="Message sent" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  <DoDont text="Your message has been sent" type="dont" aspectRatio="1:1" />
</DoDontRow>

If you'd like more detail, there are plenty of good online grammar resources, including information 
about [verb forms](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/verbs-basic-forms), [verb tenses](https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-are-the-basic-verb-tenses/), and [verb phrases](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/verb-phrases).

## Use one term per concept

Don’t use different terms (or variations of the same term) to refer to the same thing.
If you use _app_ and _application_ or _repo_ and _repository_ in the same context, a user might well start to question whether you are referring to one thing or to two separate things.

Also, avoid overloading one term with different meanings. If a certain component or process or concept is called one thing,
avoid using this same term to mean anything else. This might sound blindingly obvious, but is, sadly, all too common.

> A synonym is a word you use when you can’t spell the other one.


## Don't confuse verbs and nouns

Here are a few commonly confused verbs and nouns:

- You might _advise_ (verb) someone on how to do something. They will no doubt be grateful for the _advice_ (noun).
- Network bandwidth will _affect_ (verb) download speeds. An _effect_ (noun) of slow download speeds might be user frustration.
- To _compile_ (verb) the code, do X. After _compilation_ (noun) you can run the code.
- First you need to _install_ (verb) the software. When the _installation_ (noun) completes you will see a welcome screen.
- You might _invite_ (verb) someone to take part in the product beta. This might involve sending them an _invitation_ (noun).


## Phrases vs full sentences

It's fine to use phrases (as opposed to full sentences) in appropriate contexts, such as for headings, button labels, confirmation messages, and so on.

Page headings are a good example of where it's preferable to use short, sharp phrases (without periods) rather than full sentences.

Use your judgement as to whether phrases or full sentences are most appropriate in your product context — and then be consistent.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample type="do" text="Remove photo?" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Are you sure that you want to remove these photos?"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## The use of pronouns

<InlineNotification kind="info">

<strong>Note:</strong><br/>
The general pronoun guidance contained in this sub-section is worth knowing. However, do note that the pronoun <em>they</em> is 
now commonly used to refer to a single person whose gender is either intentionally not revealed or whose gender 
identity is nonbinary, so feel free to use <em>they</em> as a singular pronoun where relevant.

</InlineNotification>

A pronoun is used in place of a noun (for example, _she_ instead of _Ginni_ or _it_ instead of _the car_). 
This sounds simple, but it's not always so.

- In general, don’t combine a plural pronoun (_they_, _their_, _theirs_, _them_, or _themselves_) with a singular noun:

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="All employees are expected to clean their work areas before they go home."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="dont"
      text="An employee is expected to clean their work area before they go home."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

- Don’t use gender-specific pronouns such as _he_, _him_, _himself_, _his_ or _she_, _her_, _herself_, _hers_ when the gender of the subject is unknown.
- **Tip:** You can generally avoid needing to use a gendered pronoun by simply referring to _the user_.
- Don’t try to cover both genders by using a construction such as _he/she_, _(s)he_, _him/her_, _his/hers_, and so on.
- Don’t use _it_ to refer to a person.

**So what's ~~a guy~~ ~~a girl~~ one to do?**

1. You can use the [imperative mood](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/imperative-clauses-be-quiet) 
(for example, "Print document" or "Publish changes") to avoid needing a pronoun at all.
1. Use a second person pronoun: _you_, _your_, _yours_, or _yourself_.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Use the Publish wizard to deploy the application."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="You can now deploy your application."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

3. When referring to a single person whose gender is either intentionally not revealed or whose gender identity is nonbinary, use _they_.


> When I was a kid, my teacher looked my way and said, “Name two pronouns.” I said, “Who, me?


## The use of non-English words

You may think it _très chic_ to scatter a few foreign words and phrases into your copy, but is this really a good idea? _Au contraire, mon amie!_

In general, avoid using foreign (that is, non-English) words and phrases as these increase the complexity of our text and can make us look a little pretentious. _Sacré bleu!_

#### The use of "i.e.", "e.g.", and "etc."
The following 3 Latin abbreviations are still commonly used on the web, but they can cause non-native English speakers difficulty. 
So, where space allows, it is better to use an appropriate English phrase instead.

| Latin abbreviation      | Equivalent English phrases          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| i.e. (_id est_)         | _"that is"_ or _"in other words"_   |
| e.g. (_exempli gratia_) | _"for example"_ or _"for instance"_ |
| etc. (_et cetera_)      | _"and so on"_ or _"and the rest"_   |



## Avoid jargon

We need to speak the language that our users speak. Most real people don’t speak in technical or business jargon and neither should we.

Jargon can take different forms:

- The use of specialist terms, not widely understood outside of a narrow field or discipline (for example, _unquiesce the database_).
- Taking common words but applying them to new contexts, or using them to mean something different from how those words are widely used and understood
  (for example, _socialize the report_; _massage the data points_).
- Making use of figurative language (for example, _touch base_; _cherry pick any quick wins_; _drink your own champagne_).

Also, avoid cliches like the plague.\*

**Some examples:**

| 🚫 Jargon to avoid   | Guidance                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| abort / terminate    | Use a simpler, less emotive term such as _cancel_, _stop_, or _end_.                                                         |
| drill down           | Use a more direct term such as _refine_, _explore_, or _expand_.                                                             |
| drive                | Don't use in the abstract sense of driving change. Use a more concrete verb such as _control_, _manage_, or _increase_.      |
| facilitate           | Don’t use in an abstract sense such as to facilitate progress. Instead, say something specific about how you are helping.    |
| going forward        | Use _in future_ or a similar, more concrete phrase.                                                                          |
| monetize             | Re-word if possible to use more natural language, such as _chargeable_ or _paid plans_.                                      |
| no holds barred      | If there are no restrictions, it is clearer to write something such as _without restrictions_.                               |
| opinionated          | Don’t use in relation to inanimate objects or tools.                                                                         |
| religion / religious | Don’t use to refer to a person or group taking a particular stance or approach to something.                                 |
| sea change           | Simplify to _change_ or, if further emphasis is needed, _significant change_.                                                |
| socialize            | You might socialize with friends after work, but you _publish_ or _share_ a report.                                          |
| synergy              | Re-word if possible to use more natural language.                                                                            |

## Referring to UI elements

When you refer to UI elements in text, write out the UI labels exactly as they are written in the UI (that is, 
follow the same capitalization) but render the UI controls in **bold** text to make them stand out from the 
surrounding text. 

Examples:
- You can view recently performed tasks from the **Home** page.
- After you have configured your notification settings, click **Next**.
- To view more detailed information, click the **Status and logs** tab.
