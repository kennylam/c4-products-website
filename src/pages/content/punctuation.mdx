## Periods

In UI body text, full sentences end with a period. Period.

#### Exception: headings and subheadings
In general, don't use periods in headings and subheadings as these typically use short phrases, not complete sentences. 
<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
  type="do"
  captionTitle=""
  caption=""
  >

![A correct example where headings do not have periods](images/heading_correct.png)

</DoDontExample>

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
  type="dont"
  captionTitle=""
  caption=""
  >

![An incorrect example where headings have periods](images/heading_incorrect.png)

</DoDontExample>

  </Column>
</Row>


However, in the rare case where a heading or subheading comprises two or more sentences, you will need to use periods to enable the 
reader to distinguish where one sentence ends and the other begins.
<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
type="do"
captionTitle=""
caption=""
>

</Row>



### Periods and space between sentences

In body text, add one space (not two) after the period that comes at the end on a sentence.

### Periods and bullet point lists

When writing bullet point lists, adopt one of the following two approaches, based on which one makes most sense for the content:

- Option 1: Write every entry in the list as a full sentence and include a period at the end of each one.
- Option 2: Write every entry as a short phrase (that is, not a full sentence) and don‚Äôt use periods.

Don‚Äôt use a period at the end of short labels and phrases that are not complete sentences. For example, don‚Äôt use periods in button labels, links, short field labels, and so on.

### Periods and parentheses

When parentheses are used to contain supplementary information towards the end of a sentence, the period goes outside of the parentheses.
Example:

> _Use only alphanumeric characters (A-Z and 0-9)._

However, if an entire sentence is contained within parentheses, the period goes inside the closing parenthesis.
Example:

> _Use only alphanumeric characters. (If you switch to using Transport Layer Security then any UTF-8 character encoding can be used.)_

## Colons

Colons are most commonly used to introduce a list of items. Never use a semi-colon for this purpose.

In most cases, the word directly following a colon shouldn‚Äôt have a capital letter. Example:

> As a customer, I expect the following from a cloud vendor: robust security, high availability, and a pay-for-use charging model.

#### Exception
The only exception is if the text following the colon constitutes a complete (independent) clause ‚Äî that is, if the text following the colon could stand on its own as a complete sentence. Example:

> Remember Thomas Watson‚Äôs famous mantra: Good design is good business.

Colons are also used to separate two independent clauses when the second explains or illustrates the first.

## Commas

A comma marks a slight pause or break between different parts of a sentence. Used properly, commas make the meaning of sentences clear by grouping and separating words,
phrases, and clauses. Note in particular the following uses of commas.

### Commas used to separate items in a list

In a list of three or more items, always include a comma after the last but one item. (This is sometimes referred to as a _serial_ or _Oxford_ comma.)

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="IBM Product X offers fast, secure, and scalable message delivery."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

#### Exception
In button labels, checkbox labels, or radio button labels, don‚Äôt use the serial comma in a list of three or more items if an ampersand is being used.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
type="do"
captionTitle=""
caption=""
>

![Radio button labels without the serial comma](images/Radio_button_01.jpg)

</DoDontExample>

  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
  captionTitle=""
  caption=""
  >

![Radio button labels with the serial comma](images/Radio_button_02.jpg)

</DoDontExample>

  </Column>
</Row>

### Commas used to indicate parenthetical content

In this usage, a pair of commas is used in a similar way to a pair of parentheses: to separate out additional or non-essential information. Example:

> IBM Product X v8, our latest and greatest release, won the gold award.

### Commas used to mark off relative clauses

If a sentence starts with a subordinate (aka dependent) clause, use a comma to indicate where the subordinate clause ends and the main clause begins.
The preceding sentence is a case in point. Here‚Äôs another example:

> With its great feature set and first class design, IBM Product X was the overall winner.

### Commas used to indicate the person being addressed in direct speech

Here a comma alone can be the difference between: ‚ÄúWhat is this thing called love?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is this thing called, love?‚Äù Or the difference between ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat Grandma.‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat, Grandma.‚Äù

There are many other uses for commas beside the few mentioned here. If you would like to read about the other uses consult a standard grammar guide.\*

## Apostrophes

Apostrophes are used in contractions to indicate missing letters (for example, _can‚Äôt_) and to show possession (for example, _the user‚Äôs credentials_).

However, don‚Äôt use an apostrophe and letter _s_ (that is, _‚Äôs)_ to indicate the possessive form of abbreviations or company or product names.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont text="The IBM Cloud catalog..." aspectRatio="" />
  <DoDont text="IBM Cloud's catalog..." type="dont" aspectRatio="" />
</DoDontRow>


## Exclamation marks

Avoid using exclamation marks. Exclamation marks might be fine strewn through your Facebook comments, but they don‚Äôt look appropriate in a professional product UI.

By all means offer the user encouragement, but do this through stating clearly what they have achieved so far. (Don‚Äôt write like an excited cheerleader! Not cool! No way!)

#### Exception
Feel free to use an exclamation mark in a welcome greeting, such as in a sign-up email:

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont text="Welcome, Emma!" aspectRatio="" />
</DoDontRow>


## Hyphens and dashes

Hyphens and dashes have set purposes and should not be used interchangeably. 

### Hyphen (-)
- A hyphen is used to join words or parts of words.
- For example, hyphens are used to join together compound words such as _long-term_, _self-restraint_, and _mother-in-law_. 
- Numbers between twenty-one and ninety-nine should also be hyphenated when they‚Äôre spelled out. 

### En dash (‚Äì)
- An en dash (which is about the width of an uppercase N) is used to show ranges of numbers, such as times, dates, page numbers, and scores. Here are some examples:
  - The meeting is at 19:00‚Äì20:00
  - The conference is scheduled for September 1‚Äì3
  - The relevant information is on pages 15‚Äì16
  - The home team won the match 2‚Äì1

<InlineNotification>
On a Mac, the keyboard shortcut <strong>Option</strong> + <strong>Dash</strong> (-) makes an en dash.
</InlineNotification>

### Em dash (‚Äî)
- An em dash (which is about the width of an uppercase M) has a couple of purposes:
  - It can be used to indicate a pause in a sentence.
  - It can be used to draw special attention to parenthetical information. For example: "The new release ‚Äî which they had worked on for 6 months ‚Äî was finally ready."
- One way to think of an em dash is that it‚Äôs stronger than a comma, but weaker than a period.

<InlineNotification>
On a Mac, the keyboard shortcut <strong>Option</strong> + <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Dash</strong> (-) makes an em dash.
</InlineNotification>


## Symbols

Don‚Äôt use symbols in place of words.

<DoDontRow>
  <DoDont text="Files must be encrypted and less than 100 MB." aspectRatio="" />
  <DoDont text="Files must be encrypted & <100 MB." type="dont" aspectRatio="" />
</DoDontRow>

#### Exception
In button labels, checkbox labels, and radio button labels, an ampersand (_&_) can be used in place of the word ‚Äúand‚Äù to reduce the character count.

_The use of an ampersand in a button label:_
<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
type="do"
captionTitle=""
caption=""
>

![Button label that uses an ampersand](images/Button_using_ampersand.png)

</DoDontExample>

  </Column>
</Row>

_The use of an ampersand in a checkbox label:_
<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
  type="do"
  captionTitle=""
  caption=""
>

![Use of an ampersand in a checkbox label](images/Ampersand_checkbox.jpg)

</DoDontExample>

  </Column>
</Row>

_The use of an ampersand in a radio button label:_
<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

<DoDontExample
  type="do"
  captionTitle=""
  caption=""
>

![Use of an ampersand in a radio button label](images/Ampersand_radio_button.jpg)

</DoDontExample>

  </Column>
</Row>

As ever, ensure you are consistent across your product UI.
