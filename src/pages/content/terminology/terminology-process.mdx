## Overview, scope, and purpose
- Terminology is an almost infinite topic and we are **not** trying to cover it all!
- Instead, we are focused on providing guidance on some of the most common UI terms.
- We are particularly focused on and will prioritize:
  - Scenarios where terminology is currently producing an inconsistent or confusing user experience.
  - Terms used in our Cloud Paks and other strategic lead-with offerings (details <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/qk8z10isnd0ca1xsh3icxng7c5prrla7" target="_blank">here<Launch16 fill="#0F62FE" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a>).


## How to raise a terminology issue
1. First check the <Link to="/content/terminology/approved-terms">Approved terms</Link> tab (for published terms) and the <a href="https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal/projects/1" target="_blank">Terminology project board<Launch16 fill="#0F62FE" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a> (for existing terminology issues).
1. If the term is not already covered, <a href="https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">raise a new issue<Launch16 fill="#0F62FE" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a> on the `/pal` repo, using the **Terminology** issue template.
   1. Ensure you provide as much information as possible, using the prompts in the issue template.
   1. Once submitted, do share a link to your new issue with anyone who you think might be able to contribute to the work. (For example, Design, Dev, or OM colleagues from products that currently use that term or related terms.)

## What will happen next
1. The Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG) meet every week and members monitor new issues raised.
1. All new terminology issues get added to the <a href="https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal/projects/1" target="_blank">Terminology project board<Launch16 fill="#0F62FE" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a> `backlog` column.
1. When a terminology issue has a sufficient number of relevant people prepared to work on it, that group will start meeting to research the use of that term (and related terms) and draft their guidance and recommendations. At this point, the issue will be updated to `in progress`.
1. When the group has progressed the work and drafted relevant guidance, they can submit it for review.
1. When any review recommendations have been resolved, the term and its associated definition and usage guidance will be published on our <Link to="/content/terminology/approved-terms">Approved terms</Link> page and the issue will be closed as resolved.
