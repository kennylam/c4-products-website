#### The importance of consistency
- IBM's stated strategic direction is to focus on Cloud Paks and other high-value lead-with offerings.
- These offerings must look, feel, and operate in consistent ways, and the terminology they surface is a big part of this.
- Where there are terminology conflicts, we need to work together to agree on a consistent approach.

#### The scope of this terminology list
- This terminology list is provided for designers and developers working on Carbon for IBM Products offerings.
- It focuses on promoting consistency for common terms used across our portfolio.
- It is **not** intended to be an exhaustive list.

#### Contribution and governance
- Terminology issues are now handled by the Carbon for IBM Products **Design System Adoption Guild** (DSAG).
- See the <Link to="/content/terminology/terminology-process">Terminology process</Link> tab for more details.

#### The Source column
- The following 3 entries are used in the **Source** column of the data table below:
  - `Carbon` — these entries are copied directly from the Carbon <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/action-labels" target="_blank">Action labels<Launch16 fill="#0F62FE" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a> page.
  - `Carbon > Carbon for IBM Products` — these entries originated from Carbon but have been modified or extended to meet the needs of Carbon for IBM Products offerings.
  - `Carbon for IBM Products` — these entries have been defined by the Carbon for IBM Products org, following our <Link to="/content/terminology/terminology-process">Terminology process</Link>.
  - `CCPCG` - these entries are copied directly from the <a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/cloud-paks-content/terms/glossary" target="_blank">Cross Cloud Pak Central glossary<Launch16 fill="#0F62FE" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a> page.

#### The portfolio filter labels
- The portfolio labels above the data table can be used to filter the list of terms.
- Many of the terms listed are used across our IBM Software offerings and these have the `(Global)` label.
- Other terms have been defined specifically for one or more portfolios.
  - For example, the term "assistant" has a specific meaning in the `AI Apps` portfolio.
  - Other portfolios can of course use this term, but they should be aware that the existing definition and guidance has been created, tested, and adopted by the portfolio indicated.
