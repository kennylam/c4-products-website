## Overview

This pattern is intended for use with cards, tiles, or similarly styled components. Use this motion pattern in areas that are the primary focus on the page to guide the user along their journey or locate the most important information on the page. It should not be used as a secondary focus point on a page.

## Grid

Cascade can add motion to components placed inside with a grid or without.

When using Cascade with grid support it's important to follow the example code structure on Storybook and provide the rows and columns. The component will assume this structure and add the appropriate CSS classes to the columns.

## Accessibility

This motion component has built in motion accessibility. Motion may be disabled for users that have a "reduced motion" setting enabled on their device.

As always, ensure that the content added inside Cascade is accessible. Please test out keyboard navigation to make sure your page is navigable.
