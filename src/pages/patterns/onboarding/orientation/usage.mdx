## Overview

_It’s key to pinpointing areas of interest, personalizing the experience, and presenting the most relevant paths to take first, highlighting paths to AHAs. Orientation happens from the moment a user gains access to the product, post login, and supports them as they make a choice as to how they move forward. Whether it is to explore or follow a pre-set path. Orientation can and should remain a destination that a user can return to as they become acquainted with the product experience._
