## Novice to pro team

Novice to pro is led by the Security Core Experience team in service of the Security portfolio and IBM Software alike. Why are we focused on this? In-product training experiences are often misunderstood and, at worst, neglected. Modern, successful, onboarding meets the user where they are, at their proficiency within the product and as a practitioner. Anymore, a single method, such as just-in-time interventions or UI tours, will not suffice, but rather what is needed is many experience facets working in concert to deliver well-timed, well-positioned learning that is choreographed at perfect moments to continuously grow and adapt with the user over time. **Novice to pro consciously positions to be the IBM Software methodology and framework that shapes and delivers meaningful, continuous in-product learning. We aim to deliver world-class user learning experiences via an approachable, all-in-one package for product teams.**
