Prioritizing the most appropriate information in a **dashboard** is paramount. As such, dashboards can be broken into multiple categories according to the intent by which their content is displayed.

## Overview

Some dashboards will prioritize long-term trends while others might be more tactical and short-termed in nature. Each product will essentially dictate the needs of the information shown. Below are examples (while not necessarily a comprehensive list) of dashboard types.

## When to use

There are three primary types of dashboards that will be called out in this guidance: **Analytical**, **Strategic**, and **Operational** (or Tactical).

### Analytical dashboards

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

  ![Analytical dashboard](/images/dashAnalytical.png)

</Column>

</Row>

These tend to be the most complex dashboards. Analytical dashboards tend to be favored by business analysts and are known for their use of predictive or even prescriptive suggestions. 

_Favored by financial technology and healthcare._

### Strategic dashboards

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

  ![Strategic dashboard](/images/dashStrat.png)

</Column>

</Row>


KPIs and strategic goals are the name of the game with strategic dashboards. They will focus on gaining insights into the bigger picture through real-time data. 

_Favored by management and sales._

### Operational (often conflated with Tactical) dashboards 

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

  ![Operational dashboard](/images/dashTactical.png)

</Column>

</Row>


Think short-term tactics here. Typically an operational dashboard will look at specifics for the "now" and will not give as much credance to longer-term strategic goals. 

_Favored by marketing and HR._
