## Overview

A dashboard list page may often be called “Dashboards” in the UI. They can also be organized into sections or favorited and pinned to the top of the page.

  <Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

After clicking on a dashboard, users can regain access to the dashboard list page by clicking the breadcrumb above the dashboard page header.




## Anatomy of a dashboard list page

Dashboard list pages are comprised of some or all of the following elements:

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![create dashboard modal](/images/dashboardListPageAnatomy.png)

</Column>
</Row>

1. **Create new dashboard button:** Opens the dashboard creation wizard or modal.
2. **Card/list view toggle:** Switches the dashboard list page between a grid view and a table view of dashboards.
3. **Search:** Searches across all dashboard titles
4. **Dashboards:** Shows all of the dashboards you have access to, which can be organized into favorites or sections.
5. **Favorites icon:** Pins dashboards to the top of the card view or list view for easier access.
6. **Section:** A partitioned area of the dashboard used to separate and group similar content.


## When to use

- Use to manage and organize multiple dashboards.
- Use when users can create custom dashboards.
- Use when users have not specified a landing page.


## When not to use
- Don’t use if your product only has a single dashboard.


## Best practices
- If the user has access to several dashboards, use sections or allow the user to favorite dashboards they frequently access to help them organize.
- If the user has not specified a landing page, use the dashboard list page as the landing page.
- If the user has chosen a specific dashboard as their landing page, include the dashboard list page in the breadcrumb area so the user can still access it.
- Include dashboard-level actions on the list page so users have a quick way to manage their dashboards (e.g. edit, delete, share).
