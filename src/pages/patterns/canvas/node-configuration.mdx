<PageDescription>

Nodes often will require configuration after they have been added to a canvas. This configuration, typically formatted as a side panel, can be used refine small details or to establish large-scale adjustments to the canvas.

## Overview

Nodes, when being configured, should follow pre-existing patterns like the [side panel](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/cloud-pal/components/side-panel-on-cloud/usage) and [form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage/) UX. 

It is also important that the node being configured should enter into a `selected-focus` state when the configuration panel is open. This will signify which node is being configured.

### Non-prescriptive canvas positioning
When using non-prescriptive flows, the configured node should be visually-centered on the canvas. This can be done using scripts that will automatically pan the canvas to place the node in question into the visual center.
