<PageDescription>

Links are the connective lines found between nodes on a canvas. They can be used to depict varying relationships through thickness, color, and other styles.

## Overview

Differing products may have an assortment of names for links like connections, edges, noodles, or lines, but the premise is the same: defining relationship.


## States

The default state for node links is a `1px` thickness using a `$ui-04` color token. This provides a 3:1 minimum contrast against the `$ui-background` token of the canvas.  Links can be selected or hovered over to show more information about the connection between 2 points.

## Connections

There are two types of link connection styles: **directional** and **relational**.

### Directional

When connecting links from node to node, there will often be a need to communicate the direction of the overall flow. This will be done with arrowheads. There are two arrowheads currently available: open and closed arrowheads. The default is the open arrowhead as it tends to communicate more clearly when other shapes are used at the ends of the links.


<InlineNotification> 

**Note:** The filled arrow is more visible in arrow-only diagrams. The open arrow is more distinguishable in multi-ending types of diagrams. Some notations like UML use both types to mean different things.

### Relational

A variety of symbols can be used to show different types of relationships between nodes; such as squares, circles, diamonds, or even a port style that bisects a preexisting shape.

  </Column>

  
</Row>



## Routing

The shapes made by the link lines will vary from product to product. Some may need a direct line from node to node while others might require beziers or elbow joints to keep the space legible between nodes.

## Variants

Style variants include the dashed line, double line, and colorized versions. Use cases might dictate a need to differentiate the way nodes are connected to show connection strength or even forms of status.

### Dashed line

Use dashed lines to show an attempted connection, weak connection, or other differentiator

### Double line

Can be used as a way of aggregating lines and an entire list of connections with these elements. Instead of having 10 lines, it would show 1 larger line.


<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

![Double line](/images/doubleLines.png)

<Caption>
Two 1.5px lines, 2px of space between them
</Caption>


  </Column>
</Row>


### Colorized line 

Use color to show significance or a gradient to show direction. This should use at least a 3:1 contrast minimum.

Color should be used with an intent — however, do not rely on color alone to convey meaning.
