<PageDescription>

Canvases are node editors that allows the user to create flows of their choosing. Depending on the purpose of the consumer application, these flows may be **prescriptive** or **non-prescriptive**.

## Overview

### Prescriptive flows

The layout and structure of a prescriptive flow on the canvas is guided, rather than free-form. The relative position of the elements (the nodes and connections between them) determines their behavior, as they are context aware. However, the user is not able to define the elements' location. That is instead determined by the prescriptive canvas flow.

</Row>

### Non-prescriptive flows

Non-prescriptive flows are not required to follow any particularly linear path visually and may have several entry and exit points throughout the flow; allowing the user to create deeply complex interactions when building their flows. The layout and structure of the flow on the canvas is free-form rather than prescribed and the user may place elements wherever they desire.

## Style

Carbon color, spacing, and typography tokens should be used as the predominant means of creating hierarchy on the canvas, as the canvas itself will use the standard `$ui-background` token. Any typography should use `$text-01` as its color token to allow for higher contrast for legibility.

For greater specificity in node styling, please refer to the [Nodes overview](nodes/nodes-overview) page.
