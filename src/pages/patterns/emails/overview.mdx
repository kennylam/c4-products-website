A product-led strategy requires strong communication with your user. Emails provide a way to asynchronously communicate outside of the product.

## Overview

Email patterns have been created to ensure consistent communication across all IBM products. 

Your team should use transactional emails to keep users informed about their Try offer or product experience, and nurture emails to guide them towards upgrading or purchasing the product. 

- A transactional email is triggered by registration actions such as when a user signs up, upgrades, or completes any account changes. Some examples of these emails are a Trial welcome email and Trial expiration emails. 

- A nurture email is written by product teams and are product-specific. They focus on the product benefits and features, and are meant to provide information that helps convert the user into a paying customer.

The email patterns your team should use depend on the marketplace where it can be bought. Review the [Try offer](/pages/try-offers/overview) page to get more information about marketplaces, then identify the email patterns that are relevant to your product using the guidance below.

## Transactional emails

### IBM Marketplace

All IBM products are listed in the IBM Marketplace. Products can be on the IBM Marketplace autonomously or by adopting [MultiCloud SaaS Platform](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform) (MCSP). Refer to these email patterns if your product is listed in the IBM Marketplace.

### Third-party marketplaces (like AWS, Azure, or Google)

IBM Software (on-prem) and SaaS products can be listed in third-party marketplaces. It is required that any IBM product on a third-party marketplace joins the MultiCloud SaaS Platform. MCSP provides full guidance for IBM products to integrate into the AWS Marketplace (additional work is underway to expand the support to other hyperscalers, like Microsoft Azure). Refer to these email patterns if your product is on a third-party marketplace.
