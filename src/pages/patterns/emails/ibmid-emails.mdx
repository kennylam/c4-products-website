## Overview
Product teams cannot change or alter the IBMid emails that are sent to customers. However, product teams should be aware of the end-to-end IBMid email user experience which provides access to their products. 

**Attention:** The email address which receives a given IBMid email may vary by circumstance, as noted below. For example, a user's IBMid Profile **Contact** email address may differ from the email address defined as the user's IBMid. 


## Change IBMid
This email flow enables a user to change the email address used for their IBMid. The emails in this flow are sent to the user’s IBMid Profile **Contact** email address, which may be different than the user's IBMid (email address).


<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

</Column>
</Row>

When the user submits an IBMid change request in their IBMid Profile, the flow sends the following automated emails to their contact email address to 
verify the user's identity.


### IBMid change verification
This email with a 5-digit prefix and a 6-digit verification code is sent to the user's IBMid Contact email address. This email directs the recipient to
enter the 6-digit verification code into their IBMid Profile change request form. The email address used as their IBMid is not changed 
until the verification code is entered correctly.
