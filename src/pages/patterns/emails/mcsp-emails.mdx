## Overview

The IBM [MCSP](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform) email service sends the following automated emails to subscribers of IBM Try offers. These transactional emails enable your users to access and upgrade their limited-time Try experiences. Each transactional email provides a specific notice to subscribers, and are intended to complement, not replace, in-product UI messaging.  

### Try email components 

MCSP transactional Try email components are shown in the following Welcome email example: 

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Start your IBM [product_name] free trial

1. **Subscription ID**. This component contains the Try user's subscription ID for the product trial. Multiple instances of a single product trial may exist under one subscription ID. One user may have multiple IBM Try subscriptions (IDs). 
2. **Subscription expiration**. This component contains the date when this product trial expires. Thirty-day trials are a common duration. The "month day, year" format (September 28, 2024, e.g.) is recommended due to geographical differences in strictly numerical date formats.
3. **"Seller" account**. This component contains the customer's account number with the product seller. **"Seller"** is a variable for the software retailer which provided the user's subscription - either **IBM** or a third-party software seller such as **AWS**. 
4. **Instance ID**. This component contains the ID for this instance of the product trial. Depending on the product, a single trial (or purchase) subscription may include multiple instances of the product.
5. **CTA buttons**. This component contains call-to-action (CTA) buttons which prompt user action. CTAs are the primary (blue) action the user should take, and optionally, a secondary (white) action. If there is no user action required, as with the "Thank you for subscribing" email, no CTAs should be used.
6. **Transactional email footer**. This component provides access to the required legal information and notice for the transactional class of business emails, including the IBM Privacy statement.

### Transactional email footer

The required transactional email footer, included in all Try transactional emails, covers IBM legal requirements and provides links to related legal information:

## MCSP trial emails

The following emails are sent to subscribers as part of the MCSP product trial flow. As described, some emails are conditional and not sent to every subscriber.


###  Thank you for subscribing

This first MCSP email in the Try experience email flow is sent when the user subscribes to your Try offer. The email thanks them for subscribing and asks them to look for a Welcome email to use for accessing their provisioned trial instance (Trial, Sandbox Trial, or Freemium). No action is required by the user at this point, so there are no call-to-action (CTA) buttons. A text link to the SaaS Console enables the user to check on the status of their instance provisioning. 

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Your IBM [product_name] trial subscription 

![MCSP Try offer subscription email](/images/mcsp-emails/mcsp-subscribed-email.png) 

Thank you for subscribing trial email

</Column>

</Row>

###  Welcome to your trial

The next MCSP email in the Try experience email flow is sent when the user's Try instance is provisioned and ready to use. The email welcomes them to their trial (Trial, Sandbox Trial, or Freemium), and lists their subscription ID, subscription expiration date, customer account ID, and trial instance ID. The call-to-action (CTA) buttons enable the user to start using their Try instance (primary action) or to manage their subscription or trial instance through the SaaS Console (secondary action).

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Start your IBM [product_name] free trial

![MCSP Try offer welcome email](/images/mcsp-emails/mcsp-welcome-email.png) 

Welcome to your trial email

</Column>

</Row>


### Your trial is expiring 

The next email in the MCSP flow notifies the user that their Try experience will expire soon. If the user has already upgraded their Try offer (such as by purchasing a subscription), they do not receive this email. The email provides the expiration date and prompts the user to upgrade to continue using their Try instance. The CTA button enables the user to upgrade (primary action) their Try subscription. 

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Your IBM [product_name} trial is expiring soon

![MCSP Try offer expiring email](images/mcsp-emails/mcsp-expiring-email.png) 

Your trial is expiring email

</Column>

</Row>

### Your trial has expired

The next email in the MCSP flow provides notice to the user that their Try experience has expired. If the user has already upgraded their Try subscription (such as by purchasing), they do not receive this email. The email informs them that continued use of their Try environment depends on upgrading their subscription. The CTA button enables the user to upgrade (primary action) by purchasing a subscription or contacting IBM sales (secondary action). 

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Your IBM [product_name] trial has expired

![MCSP Try offer expired email](images/mcsp-emails/mcsp-expired-email.png) 

Your trial has expired email

</Column>

</Row>

### Your trial has been deleted

The next email in the MCSP flow provides notice to the user that IBM has deleted this Try instance. If the user has already upgraded their Try subscription (by purchasing a subscription within the grace period), then this original Try instance may or may not be deleted (the user may have opted for a new instance after purchasing, for example). A common grace period following trial expiration is 30 days, enabling both your product team and the user to continue with the Try instance with minimal intervention. The CTA buttons enable the user to purchase (primary action) a new subscription or to contact IBM sales (secondary action) for additional purchase options. 

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Your expired IBM [product_name] trial has been deleted

![MCSP Try instance deleted email](images/mcsp-emails/mcsp-deleted-email.png) 

Trial deleted email

</Column>

</Row>

### Thank you for upgrading

The next email in the MCSP flow thanks the user who has upgraded their Try offer, typically by purchasing a subscription. The CTA buttons enable the user to get started (primary action) with the upgraded product instance or to manage their subscription or instance through the SaaS Console (secondary action).

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Your IBM [product_name] subscription upgrade

![MCSP Try offer upgraded email](images/mcsp-emails/mcsp-upgraded-email.png) 

Trial upgraded email

</Column>

</Row>


### Your trial has been extended

The final email in the MCSP flow notifies the user when their request for a Try period extension has been granted. The email includes the subscription information and the updated expiration date. The CTA buttons enable the user to access their Try instance (primary action) or to manage their subscription through the SaaS Console (secondary action).

<Row>

<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

Subject: Your IBM [product_name} trial extension

![MCSP Try offer extended email](images/mcsp-emails/mcsp-extended-email.png) 

Trial extended email

</Column>

</Row>



## Implementation notes

Your product team should consider the following guidelines when implementing MCSP trial transactional emails: 

- The email "Subject:" line is important text which appears in the recipient's email in-box and should be implemented as described. 
- Once a trial user purchases your IBM MCSP product, the trial emails should be discontinued. In their place, transactional emails for their purchase should be started. If the user upgrades to another Try offer for your product, the MCSP trial email flow should restart with updated subscription and instance information.
- Some MCSP product trials may expire based on variables other than the number of days, such as limits on data size, number of API calls, and monetary credits. In these cases, product teams should adapt the time-limited Try design, and as needed, submit a design request to the PLG team. 
- If your IBM user cancels their Try offer (either before expiration or within the post-expiration grace period), only the "Your trial has been deleted" email should be sent. The product UI should provide messaging to confirm cancellation, collect information about the reason for cancellation, and present alternative Try offers or other options. 
- For transactional emails, IBM does not provide an Unsubscribe or Opt out method - IBM users have opted in to receiving transactional emails through their voluntary relationship with IBM, and cannot opt out of emails specific to this transaction. Marketing emails, by contrast, require an Unsubscribe or Opt out method under US “Can Spam” law and are subject to significant penalties for violations.
