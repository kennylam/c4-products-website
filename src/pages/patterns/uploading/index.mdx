## Overview

The action of uploading should always be the result of a user action.
The action of uploading a file could be done by selecting an action button
to open a modal or it may be done inline in a full page form or slide in or
over panel.

{`
 .uploading-img-1 {
   max-width: 175px;
 }
`}
</style>
<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>
  <div style="max-width:175px">

</Row>

## Upload methods

- Drag and Drop
- Choose a file

Wherever possible there should always be a drag and drop zone, using the file
drop component, as well as the ability to browse locally and select a file.
Note that file selection should be restricted to only allowed file types.
