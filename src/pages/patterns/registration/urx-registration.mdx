## Overview

URX registration allows users to register for a Sandbox Trial, Trial, or Freemium account. It is built using IBM's Unified Registration Experience (URX) and registers users for any type of Try offer, including a Sandbox Trial, Trial, or Freemium.

[URX](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/urx) is the preferred platform for standardizing the creation of compliant and trackable registration forms for use on IBM.com. It integrates applications used to set up and gate trials, software and assets, and ensures data integrity across downstream systems such as Marketo and IBM Sales Cloud (ISC). It also allows marketers to use Segment and Amplitude to track the customer registration experience.

** The Cloud Trial URX form is used by multiple registration pathways: **

1. Products which are instantiated through IBM Marketplace and are **NOT** on [MultiCloud SaaS Platform](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform) (MCSP).

2. IBM products which are instantiated through IBM Marketplace and **are on** [MCSP](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform).

3. IBM products which are **instantiated through AWS Marketplace** and are on [MCSP](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform).

This page outlines the first two pathways. Follow the guidance in the corresponding tab depending on whether your product is on MCSP.

**Note:** Users cannot access the URX registration form via the IBM Cloud Catalog. If your product's Try offer is listed in the IBM Cloud Catalog, be sure to follow the IBM Cloud registration flow.

  </Column>
</Row>

1. **Product name**
2. **Sub-headline:** “Start your x-day trial”.
3. **IBMid login:** Login option for users with an IBMid.
4. **Sign up for IBMid form:** Limited customization is allowed. Teams may elect to add optional fields such as “Are you a student?” and “Company name”, but the fields shown are the minimum requirement.  
5. **Product trial sign up panel (customizable):** Product team can customize the contents in this panel.

### Registration process

Users need an IBMid to register for an IBM Try offer. Users who already have an IBMid can log in and register right away. Users who do not have an IBMid will need to enter their account information and create a new one. 


Users who do not have an existing IBMid are prompted to continue through the registration process, including the following steps:

- **Password creation:** In order to maintain platform and account security, stringent password requirements are enforced. The user is presented with these requirements in real time upon clicking into the field, which are automatically checked off as they are met.

- **Email validation:** A verification code is sent to the user’s email which must be entered in the email verification field to confirm the user's identity and ownership of their account.

- **Notice and choice acknowledgement:** The notice and choice widget is used to obtain consent to contact the user by email and/or phone.

### Successful registration and sign up

The next time the user logs in, they will be redirected to the IBMid log in page as outlined [here](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/login-logout/ibmid-login).

## Content guidance
It’s important to use the space within the URX form efficiently, regardless of which registration pathway you’re using. Be strategic with the content you include in the left hand panel. Use this space to convey the value of your product and explain the characteristics of the type of Try experience being offered. This helps a potential user understand any limitations or benefits of registering for that type of offer. 

<Row>

  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![URX Left hand panel image](/images/urx-reg-images/URX-Left-Hand-Panel/urx-form-left-panel.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

### Left hand panel best practices
- The content added to the URX left hand panel should echo the same benefits featured on the marketing page.
- Product teams can have 3 to 5 bullet points in the URX left hand panel. 
- The list items must explain the benefits of using the Try offer.
- The list items must remind users what they are going to get from signing up for the Try offer. 
- The list items must help users to clearly understand the value of using the Try offer. 
- The use of additional content beyond bullet points such as images, badges, or animated GIFs is not permitted in URX left hand panels, and cannot be added using the IBM [PerForm](https://urx-perform.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com) tool.
