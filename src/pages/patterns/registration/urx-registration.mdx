## Overview

URX registration allows users to register for a Sandbox Trial, Trial, or Freemium account. It is built using IBM's Unified Registration Experience (URX) and registers users for any type of Try offer, including a Sandbox Trial, Trial, or Freemium.

[URX](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/urx) is the preferred platform for standardizing the creation of compliant and trackable registration forms for use on IBM.com. It integrates applications used to set up and gate trials, software and assets, and ensures data integrity across downstream systems such as Marketo and IBM Sales Cloud (ISC). It also allows marketers to use Segment and Amplitude to track the customer registration experience.

** The Cloud Trial URX form is used by multiple registration pathways: **

1. Products which are instantiated through IBM Marketplace and are **NOT** on [MultiCloud SaaS Platform](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform) (MCSP).

2. IBM products which are instantiated through IBM Marketplace and **are on** [MCSP](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform).

3. IBM products which are **instantiated through AWS Marketplace** and are on [MCSP](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform).

This page outlines the first two pathways. Follow the guidance in the corresponding tab depending on whether your product is on MCSP.

**Note:** Users cannot access the URX registration form via the IBM Cloud Catalog. If your product's Try offer is listed in the IBM Cloud Catalog, be sure to follow the IBM Cloud registration flow.

### Registration

Users need an IBMid to register for an IBM Try offer. Users who already have an IBMid can log in and register right away. Users who do not have an IBMid will need to enter their account information and create a new one. 


Users who do not have an existing IBMid are prompted to continue through the registration process, including the following steps:

- **Password creation:** In order to maintain platform and account security, stringent password requirements are enforced. The user is presented with these requirements in real time upon clicking into the field, which are automatically checked off as they are met.

- **Email validation:** A verification code is sent to the user’s email which must be entered in the email verification field to confirm the user's identity and ownership of their account.

- **Notice and choice acknowledgement:** The notice and choice widget is used to obtain consent to contact the user by email and/or phone.

### Successful registration and sign up

## IBM PerForm tool guidance
IBM PerForm is URX's form builder tool and graphical editor that can be used to create registration forms. This tool is used for IBM business and works only on the IBM intranet. 


### IBM PerForm tool Cloud Trial URX form template
The Cloud Trial URX form template in the IBM PerForm tool is used to create URX registration forms. These Cloud Trial URX forms are used for SaaS product Try offers hosted by IBM and AWS Marketplace. Product teams can use this tool to configure the Cloud Trial URX forms for their products.   

When you log in to the IBM PerForm tool, you can either create a new form or update/clone an existing form. Select the elements under Configure, Build, Design, and Publish tab to update the content and styles.

#### Configure
When creating a new form you must fill out these fields including Form name, Product name, UUCID, Target URL, and Marketo Campaign Code. Reach out to your product’s digital strategist or refer to #urx-questions Slack channel for more information.


<Row>

  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![Configure](/images/urx-reg-images/URX-Left-Hand-Panel/perform1.png)

  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![Build](/images/urx-reg-images/URX-Left-Hand-Panel/perform2.png)

  </Column>

### Design

<Row>

  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![Design](/images/urx-reg-images/URX-Left-Hand-Panel/perform3.png)

  </Column>
</Row>


1. Teams can use this feature to duplicate their existing forms. Note that this feature should not be used if you wish to make updates to an existing form, as a new form ID will be generated. Instead, update an existing form and publish updates to ensure all analytics/tracking remain consistent.
2. URX forms support multiple languages. Individual changes to wording may be made to each translated version by selecting the language you wish to update in this drop-down.
3. This toggle must be “on” in order to utilize the visual interface shown here.
4. Toggle descriptions:
  [a] Sub heading: Enable the “on” toggle to display the blue sub heading (“Start your 30-day trial”).
  [b] Edition type: If your product has multiple edition types, you can use this toggle to indicate the edition on the form.
  [c] List content: Toggles on the bulleted list with pictograms shown in this example.
  [d] Subscribed from: If your product is available on a third-party marketplace (e.g. AWS), use this toggle to indicate that on your form.
5. List content: Select a bullet point to edit its content (pictogram, header, body copy)
6. “Subscribed from” indicates the marketplace the user is subscribing from.
7. Save your form as a draft here. You can proceed to publish on the next page, or share your draft with your team.
8. List icon: toggles icons in the list content section as on or off.
9. Use this drop-down to select the number of list items you would like to show. Your form can contain 1-4 items.
10. Editor: as you select different components in the left side of the form builder, you can edit them here. Changes to the form’s layout can also be made here, such as changing button text or background images/colors.


### Publish


  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![Publish](/images/urx-reg-images/URX-Left-Hand-Panel/perform4.png)

  </Column>



1. Preview and test your form: copy the link to view your registration form draft.
2. Publish: teams can publish/update the URX forms.
3. Publish later: the information will be stored as a draft and can be edited and published later.



### IBM PerForm tool content guidance for Cloud Trial URX form
It is important to use the space within the URX form efficiently, regardless of which registration pathway you are using. Be strategic with the content you include in the left hand panel. Use this space to convey the value of your product and explain the characteristics of the type of Try experience being offered. This helps a potential user understand any limitations or benefits of registering for that type of offer. 

#### Guidance for content 
- Make sure the complete product name is specified under product name field. 
- “Start your x-day trial”. The sub-headline indicates the Try offer the user is subscribing to. 
- The first bullet point on the URX left hand panel should echo the same benefits featured on the marketing page.
- The rest of the bullet points on the URX left had panel should describe the main features.
- Product teams can have 3 to 4 bullet points in the URX left hand panel.
- The URX left hand panel list items must remind users what they are going to get from signing up for the Trial and must help users clearly understand the value of using the Trial.
- The use of additional content beyond bullet points such as images, badges, or animated GIFs is not permitted in URX left hand panels, and cannot be added using the [IBM PerForm](https://ibm.biz/PerForm) tool.
- If applicable, ensure that the Subscribe from option is enabled in the IBM PerForm tool editor to display the third-party marketplace logo (e.g AWS).

Note: 
<InlineNotification kind="info">
