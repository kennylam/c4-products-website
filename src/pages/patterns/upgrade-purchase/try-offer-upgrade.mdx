## Overview

An easy transition from a Try offer to a paid plan is crucial. This pattern should be used by IBM Cloud products to support users to complete an upgrade of a Sandbox Trial or Trial with efficiency and transparency.

## Navigating to the upgrade options

The upgrade pattern must be visible for Sandbox Trial and Trial users. The starting point of the flow is when the user is using a Try experience and hovers over the Days remaining indicator and clicks View purchase options.
