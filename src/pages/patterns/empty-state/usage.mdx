## Overview

CD&AI follows the Carbon [empty state](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern/) pattern and adds few more specific guidelines. <br />
These additional guidelines provide default header text and images for six common empty state scenarios. The images are part of the empty state coded component and can be viewed live in our Storybook, along with the default text in the table. For errors that require a full screen takeover, or where none of the page content can be shown, please refer to the [HTTP errors](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/http-errors/usage/) pattern.

## Sizes

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>

Empty states come in two sizes:

- Large: 80px/5rem
- Small: 64px/4rem

Below, you can find examples on when to use each size:

### Large

Use-cases:

- Main content area
- Empty side panel
- Tables

Examples:

## Illustrations

### Basic empty states

A subset of illustrations from the [CD&AI Illustration Library](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/illustrations/library/) has been used to provide consistency across six common empty state scenarios. If you have a specific empty state which you feel is not covered by one of these illustrations, you may choose to create a new object which more accurately represents your empty state scenario.

Characteristics of empty state illustrations:

- isometric
- monochromatic
- depicts an objects' relevance to the specific scenario

### Creating new empty state illustrations

When it comes to creating custom empty state illustrations, you have two options:

- Follow the guidelines to create new a empty state illustration in the illustration guideline.
- Reach out to the illustration team via the [#cdai-pal](https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/?redir=%2Fr-t29805298899%3Fredir%3D%252Farchives%252FCQGR0HC05) Slack channel.

## Empty state types

### No data

Common in first use experiences. Make sure to explain what will be in the empty space when it is populated and provide guidance for the user regarding next steps.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>


<EmptyStateTable
  image="/empty-state-bright-box.svg"
  alt="empty box image"
  headingText="You don’t currently have any &lt;variable&gt;."
  subText="Optional extra sentence to describe the resource and how to create one."
  buttonsText="If relevant, add a relevant CTA button"
/>

 </Column>
</Row>


### No results found

Used when the user's search parameters return no results.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>


<EmptyStateTable
  image="/empty-state-bright-magnifying-glass.svg"
  alt="magnifying glass image"
  headingText="Hmm, your search didn’t return any results."
  subText="No need for any further text as this is a common user experience. Users know to return to the search box, etc."
  buttonsText="No CTA button required"
/>

 </Column>
</Row>


### System error (API error, generic error, etc)

Used when the system can't display the information due to an error. Explain steps the user can take to find out more detail and/or to resolve the problem. For example, view an activity log.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>


<EmptyStateTable
  image="/empty-state-bright-error.svg"
  headingText="Uh oh. Something’s not quite right."
  subText="Optional: Where applicable, add further details regarding the error and how the user can fix it."
  buttonsText="Try again? 
(This will resend the request / refresh the view)"
/>

 </Column>
</Row>


### Deploying

Note: Use the generic loading state whenever possible. We’ve included this particular scenario to cover first time usage when the deployment of a new service is happening in the background.

### Not authorized

For when the user does not have permission to view the data. Suggest steps or process to request access.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>


<EmptyStateTable
  image="/empty-state-bright-lock.svg"
  headingText="You don't have have permission to view this."
  subText="Contact the admin in charge of your account to request access."
  buttonsText="Not required."
/>

 </Column>
</Row>


### No notifications

For when the user has no notifications.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>


<EmptyStateTable
  image="/empty-state-bright-notification.svg"
  headingText="You don't have any notifications."
  subText="Optional:
You can view your notifications settings [here]"
  buttonsText="Not required."
/>

 </Column>
</Row>


### No label/tags

For when the user has not created tags yet and is managing them.

<EmptyStateTable
  image="/empty-state-bright-tag.svg"
  headingText="You don't have any tags yet"
  subText="Optional:
Tags make it easy for you to find things"
  buttonsText="Create +"
/>

## Variations

### Expressive empty states

#### Full pages

Empty states that take over a full page, like in the case of 404 No page found, should use colorful and more sophisticated illustrations and follow the [HTTP error](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/http-errors/usage/) pattern.

#### Teaching moments

When seeking to teach the user about some more complex actions (such as in a wizard or in an action such as upload) you can use illustrations that contain color. See the [CD&AI Illustration Library](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/illustrations/library/) for guidance and assets to help you create your own expressive illustrations.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>


<OneColTable
  header="Assets"
  row1={
    <>
      <a href="https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/121281102229">
        Empty State illustrations
      </a>{" "}
      <span>SVG</span>
    </>
  }
  row2="Download all empty state illustrations (.ZIP)"
/>

 </Column>
</Row>


## Additional Guidelines

The large variant of an empty state includes a more detailed version of the supporting image. This layout is intended to be used in large spaces of the UI, such as empty tables and side-panels. In this variant, the image is placed to the left of the text, with the text being vertically centered.

### Tables

When possible, it is important to show the column headers alongside the empty state component, to provide further context into what would appear once the table was filled. However, if this is not possible, the component can be used without.
