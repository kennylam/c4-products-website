The use of Assist Me provides a consistent way to access supporting resources to users during their product experience. Assist Me consolidates IBMâ€™s in-app widgets, such as WalkMe, into one module that encompasses all aspects of contextual in-app user assistance.

## Overview 

This pattern can be used by all products except those in IBM Cloud.  

If your product is on the [MultiCloud SaaS Platform](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/multicloud-saas-platform)(MCSP), you can adopt the Global header and easily enable this pattern. You can then customize the features for your product, like adding in WalkMe tours, links to the product documentation, and links to the support site.

If your product is not on MCSP, you can still adopt this pattern and customize the features. You will need to work with your development team to manually implement it.
