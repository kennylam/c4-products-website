  This requires the main page content to be responsive so that the panel may slide in. For a non-responsive alternative, it is
  recommended to use the "Slide Over Panel".

## Sizing

There are three sizes (480px, 320px, and 256px), products should decide which size is appropriate depending on the content within the
side panel.
Bare in mind the content of the main page will be pushed to accommodate the panel, this should be considered when selecting
which size of panel should be used.
