### Things to consider

- Is the action uploading or is it importing?
- How many files are likely to be uploaded?

### Overview

The action of uploading should always be the result of a user action.
The action of uploading a file could be done by selecting an action button
to open a modal or inline in a full page form, slide-in or slide-over panel.
