## General guidance

Cards display a snapshot of information intended to encourage users to interact with or click to view more details or actions. According to the [Nielsen Norman group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/cards-component/), cards have 4 key properties:

> 1. Cards are used for grouping information and content.
> 1. Cards present a summary and link to additional details.
> 1. Cards resemble physical cards. 
> 1. Cards allow for a flexible layout. 

In IBM Cloud, there are two types of cards used to display content:

1. **Editable cards** group information that represents an object, object groupings or a specific aspect of an object that the user can manage.Â Their primary purpose is for viewing and modifying content *that is contained entirely in the card*. 
2. **Content cards** are intended for grouping and organizing related static content. Their primary purpose is for displaying a summary of information and do not contain an editable state.

## Anatomy

A card is composed of two distinct zones: a title and  the body. 

#### Title

The title of your card should mirror the content or summary in your card. You can also include an optional label, pictogram, or image above your header text. **Use sentence case for titles**.

#### Body 

Depending on the type and size of card you use, aim to use minimal body content in your card. Remember, cards present a summary or snapshot of information. You can place other components inside the body of card such as structured lists, data visualizations, images, links,  videos, buttons, etc. These components will occupy the full width of the card.

## Variations



### Editable cards

Editable cards allow a user to view, modify, and save the content contained within the card. These cards are generally used in instances where a user needs to make changes to a resource instances (ex. configuration details), account plan, etc. Editable cards allow a user to edit something within context. 

#### Types of editable cards:

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} noGutterSm>

| Types          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| List views     | A structured list is used to show the details, attributes or metadata of an object. A user can individually edit one more line in the list or multiple.                        |
| Summary        | Summary cards provide a brief overview of the state of an object (ex. health status, speed, creation date, etc.) and can use multiple components.                                                                                              |

**Note:** Alert the user of any unsaved changes if they're in the edit state and try to navigate away to a different page.

### Content cards

Content cards group content-related information in a logical way for the user to understand (paragraph and images, videos and accompanying text, etc). These cards can be used in a variety of ways such as:

**1. Marketing/promo/intro:** these are small cards used to show a summary of a product or functionality for the user to learn about and try out. It can be used to promote other supplementary such as docs, FAQs etc.

## Best practices


### Dos for both variations

- Intentially organize cards within the page layout by grouping related cards in sections
- Consider adding page filters if you have a large collection of cards (ex. Catalog page)
- Use [structured lists](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/code) instead of tables
- Use editable cards to show areas of the page the user can edit



### Don'ts 

- Nest a card within another element such as a table
- Do not use editable cards for complex/multi-step flows (consider using a [side panel](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/cloud-ux-patterns/Views/SidePanel/usage/))
- Do not use cards in modals
- Avoid using tables* (use an [structured list](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/structured-list/code))
- Avoid scrolling* 

_*(exceptions in extreme use cases)_
