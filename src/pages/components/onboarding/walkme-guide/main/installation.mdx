  WalkMe should be installed in your product properly in order to have a successful getting started experience. There are two different ways to install WalkMe that are dependent upon certain factors within your product.

## Before you start

Before deciding how you want to install WalkMe it's important to understand a few key things that could help reduce additional work or issues down the road.

### Segment tag injection vs Direct injection

There are two ways to install WalkMe on your product:

1. [Segment tag injection](#segment-tag-installation) is the preferred installation option. Segment is a single platform that collects, stores, and routes your user data (page visits, clicks, etc.) to tools of your choice. Segment removes the messy analytics installation process for you, so you can spend more time using your data and less time tracking it down. WalkMe provides some analytics but if you want to go beyond what’s offered there, Segment is the best way to do this.
2. The second option is to directly inject a [a code snippet](#code-snippet-installation) into every part of the UI that needs WalkMe. This method is used for on-prem airtight products but can also be used in other SaaS or on-prem products if Segment installation is not possible.

### SaaS or on prem

When choosing your installation method it's important to start by identifying where your product is hosted. If you're working with a cloud-based product, you can do the more straightforward Segment installation. If you're working with an on-prem product you have specific options based on if the product is airtight or not.

### On prem airtight vs not airtight

If your product is on-prem but not airtight, you can still use the Segment installation method, but be sure to test what happens if your user loses connection.

If your product is airtight, you will need to directly inject the code snippet and export all of your WalkMe content as a .zip file and place it directly within your codebase. The code snippet needs to point to the location of the content in your directory, using relative path. For this method, dev support is required to update content within the repo.

You can find more guidance around on-prem installation in the [On-prem installation](#on-prem-installation) section.

### SPA vs not SPA

During the installation process you also need to identify whether your product is a Single Page Application (SPA) or not. SPA products work inside a browser and do not require page reloading during use. The installation process for both SPA and non-SPA products consists of placing a Snippet into the codebase of your product. The snippet is a piece of JavaScript code that allows WalkMe to appear on your site. 

* If you have a SPA product, you place the code snippet into the `<head>` of index.html

* If it's not a SPA product, you need to place the code snippet into the `<head>` of every HTML page where you want WalkMe to appear

Note: SPA and non-SPA products can deploy WalkMe through either of the two installation methods.

## Segment tag installation

If possible, we highly recommend deploying Walkme through Segment.

Segment is a single platform that collects, stores, and routes your user data (page visits, clicks, etc.) to the tools of your choice. For example, if you're using Amplitude to visualize your product metrics, all of that data is gathered by Segment. 

Installing Segment also makes it really easy to install WalkMe. By adding the WalkMe destination to your offering’s source in Segment’s UI, Segment can automatically load WalkMe’s script on every page that contains Segment instrumentation without any changes or manipulation to your offering’s code base. WalkMe then uses the data that Segment gathers to trigger ShoutOuts and other components to the right user at the right time. 

To request Segment access, please reach out to john.m.manion@ibm.com. 

### Why installing WalkMe via Segment is recommended:

* Centralized management: You can toggle WalkMe on/off without depending on development cycles
* Seamless data integration: You can aggregate WalkMe events, offering events/milestones, and server-side events (e.g. SSM) in Segment while maintaining a consistent user ID (through IBM ID)
* Data privacy compliance: Through Segment’s TrustArc integration, you can Leverage clients’ global cookie preferences to deploy WalkMe in a compliant manner (required vs. functional cookies)

## Code snippet installation

If installing Segment isn’t an option for your product you can also directly install WalkMe using a code snippet that can be inserted into every part of the UI that needs WalkMe. However, this means that you won't have the extra analytics capabilities that Segment can provide. 

Similar to the Segment code snippet, you just add it to the `<head>` of a single page application or on every `<head>` of every html page.

## On-prem installation

There are two main types of on-prem installation to consider for WalkMe: 

1. "Airtight" installations where the product doesn't have internet access 
2. "Not Airtight" installations where the product has internet access

Note: If the product has intermittent internet access you can use either option. 

### Airtight

At a high level when you have an airtight WalkMe installation you can no longer use Segment and the WalkMe files have to be installed locally on the product.

The API Connect team has been able to implement this solution, here are the high-level steps they took: 

1. Ask your WalkMe support person to turn on the Self-Hosted option
2. Download .zip file from the WalkMe analytics site
3. Developer puts the contents of the .zip file into product code repo
4. Developer ensures the servers are setup for the WalkMe Self-Hosted option

To update the flows their developer created a script in the product repo to make it easier to update flows, but if you don't have that script just repeat steps 2 and 3 above for every update. The APIC team's update process looks like this:

1. Developer places the script in the product repo, and instructions in the Wiki
2. Open Terminal
3. Clone the product repo (first time only)
4. cd (move) into product repo
5. Run the script as shown in the instructions
6. Get someone to merge PR and check that it looks correct once merged

On-prem installations require quite a bit more collaboration with development than the cloud-based implementations. In addition to having development add the files to the product repo, any updates have to be made on the development timeframe. This means that you have to align with code freezes, QA, and other development processes.

### Not airtight

You can install WalkMe on on-prem products that are connected to the internet the same way you'd install it within a cloud-based product.  While you can directly load files locally, we recommend using the Segment installation process.
