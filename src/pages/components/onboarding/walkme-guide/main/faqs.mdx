## Design guidelines

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="How strict are these guidelines?">We encourage you to use as much of our guidance as possible to help keep our products consistent and prevent you from having to create everything from scratch.</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="What happens if the sketch kit doesn't meet my needs?">If you find that the WalkMe sketch kit lacks a component you need, reach out to the Getting Started design team to discuss alternative options. If we find that your suggested components could help other teams, we can look into adding it to the WalkMe library.</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Can I create my own WalkMe components?">The current library of WalkMe components have been passed through checks and meet IBM carbon and Brand standards. Reach out to the Getting Started design team to explore your options if you wish to create a custom component.</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>


## Working with the WalkMe editor

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="What is the WalkMe editor?">The WalkMe Editor is used for building, managing, and publishing your WalkMe patterns and components.</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="How do I get access to the editor?">Reach out to the Growth team to get access to the correct WalkMe editor.</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>


## WalkMe process

<Accordion>

  <AccordionItem title="How do I know if my team is ready for WalkMe?">Although you can only build in WalkMe once your product is developed, you will want to align with your team on your users getting started needs as soon as possible. As soon as your team has wireframes for your product, you should start thinking about your WalkMe implementation.</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="What if my team doesn't have designers?">The WalkMe templates should enable a team to follow the design guidance even if your team doesn't have designers. If you feel you need additional design guidance, reach out to the Getting Started design team.</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Who owns the WalkMe implementation?">Getting WalkMe installed on your product should be owned by the development team. However, WalkMe flow creation can be owned by anyone from OM, Content, Design, or Dev.</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Who am I supposed to be talking to? Who approves my tour designs?">You should constantly share and review your work within your product team as if it were any other design. Additionally, the DUX review includes a getting started category on how your WalkMe designs will be reviewed. The Getting Started team does not need to approve any of your flows. We are simply here to help.</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="Who do I need to align with?">You should align with your product team, but also consider the overlap your product may have with other teams as well (ie. Paks, on Cloud, etc.)</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem title="How do I get buy-in to prioritize WalkMe?">We can attest to the success of WalkMe because we have seen an uptick in product usage and retention rates due to users completing WalkMe flows. For more detailed information reach out to the Getting Started design team.</AccordionItem>
