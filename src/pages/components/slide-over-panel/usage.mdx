title: Slide-over panel
tabs: ['Usage', 'Code']
---

The slide over panel opens as the result of a user
action and can be opened from anywhere in the product UI. It will overlay the
main page content. 

This component is an empty framework that can have product-defined context
relevant content.

which size is appropriate depending on the content required within the side
panel.

## Overlay

The default state of the component is to overlay the page content with the standard Carbon-theme overlay. However, in some situations, the content of the page is used to navigate the content of the slide-over panel. 
In this case, do not overlay (darken) the content of the page below the panel. 
Ensure that there is also a method for navigation inside the panel so that the user does not need to rely on the navigation method below the panel.
