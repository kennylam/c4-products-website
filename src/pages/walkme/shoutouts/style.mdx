<PageDescription>

  ShoutOuts should be clear and concise, and speak directly to the user. They should contain just enough information for your user to get an understanding of the feature or tour.

#### 1. Header (55 characters):

If you're using a ShoutOut to kickoff a tour, the header should welcome and speak directly to the user. It should state what they will accomplish within the tour. **Pro-tip:** The header for this modal can match the label in the Player.

If you're using a ShoutOut to call out a specific feature, make sure you're highlighting the direct value to the user and how it will help them do their job. Avoid anything that might sound like sales or marketing.

#### 2. Body text (310 characters):

This content should be clear and concise (2-3 sentences). It should say exactly what the user will accomplish within the tour or the value of the specific feature.

#### 3. Buttons:

Should give the user two options to either start a tour or explore the UI on their own.

Popular button labels:

* **Primary button:** Let's go!; Start tour
* **Tertiary button:** Maybe later; Explore on my own
