<PageDescription>

  Popups have multiple uses within a Smart Walk-Thru. You can use them to start and end a tour, or provide additional information that isn't directly anchored to a specific part of the UI.

## Style and usage

<br />

### When starting a tour

All tours should include a welcome popup that explains exactly what the user will do within a tour. Keep things short and concise, but be sure to highlight the value of this particular feature or action. 

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

![visuals](images/WalkMe-SWT-popups-1.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

<br />

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):

If you're using a Popup to kickoff a tour, the header should welcome and speak directly to the user. It should state what they will accomplish within the tour. Pro-tip: The header for this modal can match the Player title.

#### 2. Body Content (310 characters):

This content should be clear and concise. It should say exactly what the user will accomplish within the tour and the value it will bring.

#### 3.Buttons:

Should give the user two options to either start a tour or explore the UI on their own.

**Popular button labels:**

* Primary button: Let's go!; Start tour
* Tertiary button: Maybe later; Explore on my own

<br />

### Popups with Videos

You can provide your user with a video within a popup to explain information that may not be possible or as concise with WalkMe alone. For example, if the feature requires your user to leave the product and connect a third-party product where WalkMe cannot be installed, a quick video of how to do that would be the best option. Videos can also give a quick overview of the product itself and give context before your user engages with a tour.

  <Column colLg={8}>

  </Column>
</Row>

<br />

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):
The header should welcome and speak directly to the user. It could be consistent with the title of the video.


#### 2. Body Content (310 characters):
This content should be clear and concise. It should say what the user could expect to see in the video along with what happens next should they choose to skip the video.


#### 3. Video (310 characters):
- The video should be 16x9 aspect ratio
- Keep the video as short as possible to increase engagement


#### 3.Buttons:
You can choose to have one or two buttons depending on if there is more after the video for the user to interact with.


**Popular button labels:**
- **Primary button:** Let's go!; Start tour; Next
- **Tertiary button:** Maybe later; Explore on my own

<br />

### When ending a tour (optional)

Just like any good story, every tour should have a clear ending. Within a Step-by-Step guide we recommend using a Popup to congratulate the user and, if applicable, guide them to additional resources or tours.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

![visuals](images/WalkMe-SWT-popups-2.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

<br />

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):

Congratulate the user for completing the tour or task. Remember to be encouraging and engaging.

#### 2. Body Content (310 characters):

This is a good time to give the user a quick summary of what they've just walked through and accomplished.

If there were multiple sections of the tour, feel free to list a summary of those sections and what they helped the user to accomplish. If applicable, provide a call to action to the next tour in the sequence or additional resources.

#### 3.Buttons:

This would be a great time to suggest other tours that the user may want to explore.

* **Primary button:** Finish; Done
* **Tertiary button:** Explore more

### Editor bug

Currently, there is a WalkMe bug when trying to utilize a Popup within the Smart Walk-Thru. The design shows first as a Step Balloon, and you must select Change Design in the editor window and reapply the correct template in the gallery. Protip: Popups are styled like ShoutOuts.
