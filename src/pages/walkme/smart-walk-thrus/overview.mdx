<PageDescription>

  The Smart Walk-Thrus feature allows you to create step balloons within your product that guide users through any process. Just like a GPS takes you from start to finish where you want to go, a Smart Walk-Thru will take your users through any process with interactive step-by-step guidance.

## Use cases

You can use Smart Walk-Thrus to build various types of in-app guidance and tutorials, but the two most common use cases for getting started experiences are: 

- [Overview pattern](/walkme/walkme-patterns/overview-pattern) that point out specific parts of the UI and help orient new users or highlight new features
- [Task pattern](/walkme/walkme-patterns/task-pattern) that help a user complete a specific task 

## Components

The Smart Walk-Thru feature includes the following components:

* [Popups](/walkme/smart-walk-thrus/popups) are large modal components that appear in the center of the screen, unattached from UI elements. Within our current visual guidance, Popups and ShoutOuts follow the same style guidance.
* [Steps](/walkme/smart-walk-thrus/steps) are tip balloons that point to specific elements in the UI or prompt the user to do something.
