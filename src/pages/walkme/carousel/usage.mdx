The carousel can be used as a substitute for a Popup or ShoutOut. In order to implement an effective Carousel, you must first determine which [pattern](/walkme/walkme-patterns/overview) your use case falls into. 

Use cases for Carousels:

- Warmly welcome a new user to the product
- Give a new user some context and value provided by the product
- Provide additional or background information about a tour 
- Make announcementsâ€“like new features or updates
