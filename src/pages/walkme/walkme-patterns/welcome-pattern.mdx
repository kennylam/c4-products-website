<PageDescription>

Welcome patterns provide guidance on the best ways to introduce your users to your offering. This is the first screen your users will see–it's usually a ShoutOut or Carousel. This guidance will help you welcome your users to best inform them of your product's values and capabilities.

## Usage

**Used to**: 
- Warmly welcome a new user to the product
- Give a new user some context and value provided by the product
- Make announcements–like new features or updates

**Not used to**: 
- Teach the user how to do something
- Show the user around the UI

Best practices
- Keep the content to a minimum to avoid annoying the user upon opening the product
- Focus on the value of the product
- If the value of the product does not require much explanation, then you might not need a welcome experience
- At the end of the flow, point out where they can access that experience and others


## Components

Welcome patterns can be created using [ShoutOuts](/walkme/shoutouts/usage) or Carousels.
