4. **Chevron icon:** The chevron icon indicates if the checklist preview is open or closed.
5. **Section label (optional):**  When multiple tasks fit into a category, use a section label to summarize the tasks. 
6. **Status indicator:** The status indicator icon helps the user know their progress on a task.
7. **Task name:**  The name of the task should be brief and clear and be limited to two lines. 
8. **"View all" link:** The "view all" link takes users to a full view of tasks and indicates the number of tasks displayed in the full list.


### Status Variants

The checklist component leverages Carbon’s [status indicator pattern](https://carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/status-indicator-pattern/#medium-attention) to provide users with a quick way to evaluate the status of a task.

| Status   | Purpose                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------             |
| Not started   | Indicates that a task has not yet been started.                                                                      |
| In progress   | Indicates a task has started but has not been finished. For items where the actual progress is unknown (e.g. WalkMe smart walk-throughs), mark the task as ‘in progress’ if the user clicked the task until it is known that the task has been completed. |
| Completed     | Indicates a successfully completed task.                                                                       |
| Completed - not clickable | Indicates a successfully completed task which cannot be revisited.                                                     |
| Error | Indicates an error associated with the task that needs attention.                                                     |

## Content

### Section label (optional)
