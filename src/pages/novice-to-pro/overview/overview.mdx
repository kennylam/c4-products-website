## Overview

**Users expect product UIs to be immediately intuitive and guide them to value.** They want quality experiences that deliver the answers they need so they can focus on doing their jobs better. The equation to achieve this is multi-faceted and requires a holistic approach to deliver “delightful experiences.” Users make up all proficiency levels and come from varying degrees of organizational maturity, so it’s paramount to consider how they are introduced and guided through use. Even if the experience provides immense benefits, if a user fails to quickly identify and onboard to value, the risk of abandonment increases. More so, it can negatively impact trust, brand reputation, and become more costly long-term.

Novice to pro’s driving intent is to complement experiences by guiding users of all proficiencies toward value, and to do so continuously as users mature, and as the product matures. To help increase user satisfaction and retention via a complementary experience of thoughtful nudging, continuous onboarding, and contextual support.


## Framework structure

As a holistic framework, novice to pro is structured as 3 main components: **Experience playbook, components & implementation, signal tracking.**

### Experience playbook

To properly craft an experience that resonates, you must start by identifying user value moments within the experience, deeply understand users’ driving motivation to engage, and then translate those into the best assistance companion to guide them towards realizing aha moments and sustainable success.

The purpose of the experience playbook is to help your team work together to identify these key areas, translate them into deliverable user stories, choreograph the stories as continuous user experiences over time, and then execute on them using novice to pro components. For step-by-step guidance, visit the experience playbook.

### Components & implementation

Users are driven by varying motivations and desire to engage with experiences in different ways. Novice to pro components are built with this in mind. The goal is to equally support users who want to figure things out on their terms as well as those seeking explicit step-by-step guidance through learning paths and tutorials. Components are Carbon-native and delivered via a factory model to keep the novice to pro code within the product light, the implementation easy, and the files in a single place for easier content translation and maintenance. Novice to pro consists of the following components, designed to be choreographed with each other and natively complement experiences: Interstitial screen, coachmark, inline tip, guide banner, and non-linear reading.

### Signal tracking

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

The signal is the underlying analytics current that holds the experience together. It serves two main functions: to choreograph and personalize learning experiences for users, and to track engagement so product teams can  continuously adapt the experience to meet user needs. Novice to pro leverages Segment for event tracking and Amplitude for strategic insights.

#### User experience choreography

As users grow and mature with the product, so should the experiences they are continuously onboarded to. Upon the first-time use in a new experience, users are often inundated with a lot information as they are trying to orient to a new ecosystem and find the first steps towards obtaining value. If everything is shown to the user upon this first-time engagement, the chances of retention and subsequent use are low. Timing and choreography when introducing new workflows are key because humans’ memory cognition is limited.

> On average, recollection drops 60% after just 19 minutes, and 40% after an hour¹, particularly if the information isn’t directly relevant to the task the user is trying to complete. 

Because of this, segmentation and milestones should be used to inform when to show teaching moments for optimal impact. Memory retention runs parallel with motivation, thus contextually choreographed teaching application has more long-term benefit to adoption. Use the [experience playbook](/novice-to-pro/experience-playbook) to identify the first moment of aha value, then prioritize what the user should learn and adopt as they continue to mature with the product. Use the signal to track engagement and deliver teaching moments, both contextually and over the course of time.

#### Analytics strategy

<Row>
<Column colMd={8} colLg={8}>

The novice to pro signal should be considered a means to measure user experience engagement, to tune areas causing turbulence, and to monitor/report improvement over time. A few key strategic areas where the novice to pro signal can be used as a part of the analytics strategy are the following:
