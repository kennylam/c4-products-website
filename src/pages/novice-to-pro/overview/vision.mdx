## Vision

In-product training experiences are often misunderstood and, at worst, neglected. Modern, successful, onboarding meets the user where they 
are, at their proficiency within the product and as a practitioner. Anymore, a single method, such as just-in-time interventions or UI 
tours, will not suffice, but rather what is needed is many experience facets working in concert to deliver well-timed, well-positioned 
learning that is choreographed at perfect moments to continuously grow and adapt with the user over time.

**Novice to pro consciously positions to be the IBM Software methodology and framework that shapes and delivers meaningful, continuous 
in-product learning. We aim to deliver world-class user learning experiences via an approachable, all-in-one package for product teams.**

### Our process

The novice to pro team follows the ["understand, explore, deliver"](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/getting-work-done/design-process/overview) process. There is a substantial amount of understanding required to deliver meaningful learning experiences, therefore:

- We generatively research to understand the learning landscape, user consumption, best-in-class examples, competitive edges, and behavioral experience interactions and expectations.
- We iteratively user test new experiences and components to ensure what we deliver is informed and successful.

The Novice to Pro team scopes work to deliver early and often, therefore:

- We focus on themes within each of our stages that span multiple quarters. We deliver work incrementally, targeting every ~2 months.
- We publish universal components & patterns via Carbon for IBM Products.
- We publish usage guidance via Carbon for IBM Products PAL.
