## General guidelines

On catalog details page (also known as create IBM offering and provisioning/configuration pages), the summary component appears when a user is creating a new service and configuring its details. Depending on the service, the summary component can show different content such as the details of a promo code, itemized costs of a service, etc. 

The summary highlights the default choice(s) when a user first lands on the page, and updates the choices made as they provision the service. The choices are shown with a title and a subtitle.

If a user navigates away from the page, the summary should be filled with their last changes if they decided to come back at a later time. 

## Anatomy

#### Placement
The summary component is a grid influencer and stays fixed on the right side of the page, just below the global nav. 


#### Title
The title should only contain the word “Summary”. Please do not introduce new terminology or labels in the title area. 


#### Content area
Depending on the service, the summary component can include content such as an itemized list of costs for a service or a promo code field. If you're unsure about what types of content can go in the summary component, please reach out to the [Cloud PAL team](https://ibm-cloudplatform.slack.com/messages/CGFD1CV4J). 

#### Pricing & currency
The itemized list of costs should all be in the same currency (ex. euros. U.S. dollars, etc.).

#### Terms and condition agreement
When a user is creating a new service, they need to read and agree to the _Terms and Conditions_ agreement. The create button is disabled until they check the box.

#### Buttons
There are two buttons, one required primary button "Create" and one optional secondary button, which can say "Save", "Clear" or "Save as template" depending on the use case. The buttons always stick to the bottom of the page and lie above the fold. 

If your service requires a reset or clear button in the summary component, be sure to include error checking and notify the user they will lose their changes.

**Note: these button labels are still being explored and tested. **
