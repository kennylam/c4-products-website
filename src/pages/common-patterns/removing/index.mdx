This action removes an object from a list or item; however, the object is not destroyed as a result of the action. Multiple objects can be removed at once.

## Low impact

As removing does not destroy an asset, typically user confirmation is not required.

## High impact

When removing has a high impact:
- Require user confirmation
- Text should tell the user the consequences of the removal and that the action cannot be undone.
- Optionally, when the remove button is selected it changes to show ‘Removing’.
