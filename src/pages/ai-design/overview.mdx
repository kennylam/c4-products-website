## What are intelligent systems? 

Artificial intelligence has captured the imagination of the world by unlocking the value of data anywhere, turning it into meaningful insights that matter everywhere. Companies want the speed, efficiency and innovation that comes with moving to the cloud, along with the best AI for unearthing hidden insights, automating time-consuming tasks and helping improve overall business performance. That's why IBM is laser focused on helping clients thrive by tapping into the immense power of hybrid cloud and AI.

Intelligent systems collect and analyze data, perceive relationships, learn from experience, and respond to the world around them. At IBM, we have numerous products and services with intelligent capabilities that adapt to users and augment their experience, and these AI features are rapidly growing in volume. As this transformation takes place, the need to consider the relationship between humans and intelligent systems is expanding too. 

- What is the AI doing? 
- Why should users trust it?
- Who controls what the AI can do?
- How can the AI improve over time?
- Where is the AI making an impact?

These are all human-centered questions product teams need to make part of the regular design and development process in order to deliver experiences that embody IBM's AI values and standards. Designers, with their unique understanding of user needs and desires, are at the heart of evolving intelligent systems into loved systems.

## Why these patterns exist 

As AI is infused into all IBM products and services, it is increasingly important that we as designers provide a consistent user experience across every touch point. What's more, designers and their teams bear accountability for creating AI experiences that are valuable, trustworthy and loved. 

Designers are integral to identifying the AI use cases that will add the most value, help architect the AI's decision making processes to ensure it's delivering the right insights, articulating the AI's impact, and progressively disclosing levels of explainability so that diversely skilled users can make an informed decision about which  recommendations will help them get their work done faster, smarter and with greater confidence. 

By infusing the following design patterns and components for AI explainability, you'll be ensuring best practices for building trustworthy relationships between your users and Watson. Thank you!

## Design principles

These patterns were created with a number of AI design principles in mind. As you adapt the components to suit your specific AI use cases, ask if you're upholding the following values: 

- **Trust**: Broad adoption of AI requires trust from end users. This means providing assurance that the intelligent feature is relevant, reliable, fair, and inclusive. 
- **Transparency**: Whether AI is operating in the background or called out explicitly within the product, users can clearly understand what it's doing and why. AI is not magic and we are honest with users about what the system is capable of. This includes providing clear explanations of how the AI works, how an insight was determined, the data in use, and the IBM data, security, privacy and ethical policies it embodies. 
- **Augmentation**: AI removes friction in the user's workflow. Ideally, the AI delights users by identifying insights and recommending actions in natural language that would have been too complex or painstaking for a human to do themselves. 
- **User control**: Our users have choices about whether they leverage AI's capabilities. By providing clarity into the AI's findings, we help users make informed decisions about the best action to take. 
- **Learnability**: Our AI features get better over time. As they learn from users, the results and experiences improve. 

## When to use the Watson name and logo 

At IBM, the term Watson encompasses all of the AI we create. In the near future Watson will be an everyday component of all IBM products – rather than a special feature we need to call to the user's attention. With that in mind, we are guided to use the Watson name, logo, and related branding sparingly - reserving Watson branding for best-in-class, approved Watson Moments (see the Watson Moments section below) that are worthy of interrupting a user's experience because they add tremendous value and build love and trust in Watson.

For Watson features in our products, this means that instead of using headings such as "Watson insight" or "Watson recommendation", simply title it as an "Insight" or "Recommendation" or "System prediction" – any simple nomenclature that describes the feature or its purpose. We also recommend avoiding use of the term "AI" within the content as it is implied that the system-generated suggestion is intelligent. 

There may be exceptions to this rule, including the following: 
- Products may use the Watson name and logo in their product overview or documentation to indicate that the tool is "embedded with Watson", "with Watson infused", or simply, "with Watson". 
- Explainability, progressive disclosure, or "learn more" content may include mention of Watson to inform users of the technology behind their insights, recommendations, or predictions. 

Note that this guidance relates to AI _features_ within products, and not products that have Watson within their name, e.g. _Watson Studio_.  

## Where "Watson Moments" fit into the picture

Watson Moments are branded, in-product experiences of the most exciting, valuable, trustworthy Watson insights. All other instances of Watson and AI (you'll often hear them referred to as Watson Embeds) in IBM products should refer to these general AI guidelines. 

#### Watson Moments value to customers
Differentiation with trustworthy “wow” AI 
Add tremendous customer & user value

#### Watson Moments value to IBM
Accelerate Watson adoption 
Elevate Watson quality
Amplify Watson brand

#### How Watson Moments are unique from other Watson Embeds or AI features

- **WOW**:Moments go above and beyond what the user expects from the product by providing insights, optimizations and automations that would be near impossible for a human to achieve otherwise
- **Only possible with AI**: Moments use three or more sources of related data to determine an insight
- **Highly valuable**: Moments are triggered to appear when highly relevant to what the user is doing at the time AND highly confident in the accuracy of their insight
- **Occasional, not obstructive**: Moments are infrequent in nature due to their high standards and to maintain their relevance to the user
- **Trustworthy**: Moments can explain the derivation of their confidence, why the data sources are relevant to the user and how the AI came to its conclusions. They provide recommendations users can choose from to optimize results towards various goals. They also explain and provide access to the IBM AI, data, security and privacy policies at play.
- **Watson brand amplifiers**: Moments have a distinct visual style and branding, however only approved AI features may use these UI patterns (visit the Watson Moments PAL to access the sketch kit and guidelines).
