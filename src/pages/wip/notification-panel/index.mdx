<PageDescription>

 The notification panel acts as a store for toast notifications, allowing the user to view and interact with them all in one place. This is particularly useful as by default, toast notifications disappear after a few seconds.

## Behaviour

### New notifications
The notification panel is housed within the header, under the bell icon. When the user receives a new toast notification in the UI, it is indicated as a dot within the notification panel icon. This dot remains until the panel has been opened and closed again. 

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

  </Column>
</Row>

### Slide over panel

The notification panel is a slide over panel. This ensures that the user doesn't lose their place in the UI while interacting with notifications.  
There are two main ways the user opens the notification side panel. The first is by clicking the bell icon in the header bar, which launches the slide over panel. Additionally, if the user sees a toast notification, clicking on it launches the notification panel.

### Dismissing notifications

Dismissing a toast notification in the UI, or allowing it to time out, does not result in it being removed from the notification panel.  
To clear all notifications from the notification panel, the user clicks "Dismiss all" within the panel itself.

  <Column colLg={8}>

## Optional modifiers

### View all

If appropriate, the notification panel includes a "View all" link, which opens up notifications in a separate full page design. This may be useful if the user has too many notifications to fit easily within the side panel.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

  </Column>
</Row>

### Expandable notifications

Expandable notifications may be used when there is useful extra information about a specific notification. An example is that for error notifications, there could be more information about the error presented to the user, as well as a suggested fix.
