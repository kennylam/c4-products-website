<PageDescription>

Global search is the primary search across all of Cloud Pak Platform that allows users to search for everything they have access to on the platform.

<InlineNotification>
Until we are able to merge all of the Cloud Paks, this Global Search design will only allow the user to search within the current pak the user is in. Currently, Cloud Pak for Data is the only pak that has Global Search.Â

## Overview

#### What Global Search is
Global search is a way to find existing work and resources that can be leveraged in the user's work and a way to get an overview of existing information around a particular keyword. It can be used to quickly jump to a workspace or asset in the platform. Users are only able to search for things they have access to.


#### What Global Search is not
Global search is NOT a primary repository for information, a place to search for help, or a place to monitor asset status and gain operational information.

The global search bar appears in the global header on all pages across CPP. It can be launched from anywhere on the platform and behaves the same, regardless of where the search is initiated from.
