### Type filter applied

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![ Search Results (with filters) Anatomy](/images/AnatomySearchResults-Filters.png)

</Column>

</Row>

8. **Filter tags:** Appear at the top of the result tiles as filters are applied  


## Layout grid
Global search uses the Carbon [2x Grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview/), narrow mode as the base layout grid. The filter panel sits on 4 columns and the result tiles sit on 12 columns. 

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![ Layout Grid ](/images/LayoutGrid.png)

</Column>
</Row>


## Page header

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Page header](/images/SearchResults-PageHeader.png)

</Column>
</Row>



1. **Return To breadcrumb:** A link to the page the search was launched from

<InlineNotification>
Currently we are using the breadcrumb component. However, our ideal solution contains the
<a href="https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/cloud-paks/integrated-framework/components#returnto-banner"> Return To banner</a>, which we will adopt when the code is ready. 
</InlineNotification>

2. **Search results title:** Informs the user of the searched keyword


## Result tiles

The result tile will display key attributes dynamically based on what is available for that asset.

#### Default attributes

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Result tile (default)](/images/ResultTiles02.png)

</Column>
</Row>


1. **Object type**
2. **Result name:** Click on result name to navigate to the object
3. **Breadcrumb:** Navigates the user to the breadcrumb's location when clicked on

<br/>
<br/>

#### Optional attributes

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Result tile (with additional attributes)](/images/Results-Optional.png)

</Column>
</Row>



4. **Description:** A description will only appear if it has been defined for a given object
5. **Additional attributes:** Dependent upon the result's Type. Different results may have different additional attributes 
'Owner' or 'Modified by' and 'Created on' or 'Modified on' are common across all Types
6. **Tags:** Tags are assigned when an object or asset is created. They appears as their own line underneath the additional attributes

### Highlighting

Matched keyword should be bolded in Carbon `text-01` everywhere it appears in the result tile.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Result tile (highlighting)](/images/ResultTiles-Highlighting.png)

</Column>
</Row>


### Maximum width
- The maximum width of the description is 80% of the result tile.
- The first column of additional attributes has a max width of 30% the length of the result tile. 
- The second column of additional attributes has a max width of 48% the length of the result tile.
- There should be a 16px spacer to separate the two columns.
- Content is truncated if it exceeds its max width.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Result tile (content width)](/images/ResultTiles-ContentWidth.png)

</Column>
</Row>



## Empty and error states

### Empty state
Display the empty state if user conducts a search that yields no results. This occurs when:


1. The user types in a keyword that does not have a match

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Empty state (no match)](/images/EmptyState01.jpg)

</Column>
</Row>



<br/>
<br/>

2. The user applies too many filters and there are no results that fit the filter criteria

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Empty state (too many filters)](/images/EmptyState02.jpg)

</Column>
</Row>




### Error state
If the user conducts a search that results in an error (i.e. 404 error) display the error state.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={12}>

![Error state](/images/ErrorState.jpg)

</Column>

</Row>


## Filters

### Filter levels
There are two filter levels.
- **Level 1 Default filters:** Appear by default
- **Level 2 Subfilters:** Appear when a Type is selected. The set of subfilters may be different depending on the selected Type.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![Filter levels](/images/SearchResults-FilterLevels.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Types of filters

The filter panel contains 3 different types of subfilters:
- [Single select](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/filtering/#single-selection)
- [Multiselect](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/filtering/#multiselect)
- [Date filter](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/date-picker/usage/)

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![Filter types](/images/FilterTypes.png)

</Column>
</Row>



<br/>
<br/>

For each subfilter, the top 6 options will be displayed by default. If the number of subfilter options exceeds 6, a [combobox](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage/#combo-box) will be present.
If the searched for item is in the displayed list, the order of the list will be maintained.
If the searched for item is not in the displayed list, it will be appended to the top of the list. 


<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![Combobox interaction](/images/ComboboxInteraction.png)

</Column>
</Row>




### Cancel and Apply

<InlineNotification>
For the interim design, the filter panel will have 'Cancel' and 'Apply' buttons which will enable the changes that are made within the filter panel. 
In our ideal design, we will not have the 'Cancel' and 'Apply' buttons and instead, the results will update as filters are applied.
</InlineNotification>

By default, the 'Cancel' and 'Apply' buttons are disabled. When subfilter options are selected, the 'Cancel' and 'Apply' buttons become active. 
When changes are applied, the 'Cancel' and 'Apply' buttons become inactive once again until further changes are made.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![Apply and Cancel](/images/Filters-ApplyCancel.png)

</Column>
</Row>


- **Cancel:** Reverts back to the previous selections.
- **Apply:** Applies any changes made in the filter panel to the search results.

### Filter tags

As filters are applied, they appear as tags above the result tiles. They will appear in the order in which they are added.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![Filter tags](/images/FilterTags.png)

</Column>
</Row>



- Multiselect options appear as their own tags
- The format is < Filter name > : < Option >
- To clear the filters using the filter tags. the user can select "Clear all"
- If the user wants to clear a single filter, they may do so in the filter panel

<InlineNotification>
When we are able to remove the 'Cancel' and 'Apply' buttons, we will update the filter tags from the default tag component to the filterable tag component.
</InlineNotification>

<br/>
<br/>

#### Filter tags overflow
Filter tags may extend up to the spacers/edge of the result tiles (indicated by the spacer).
If there is overflow, the next filter should be pushed to the next line.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![Filter tags overflow](/images/FilterTagOverflow.png)

</Column>
</Row>
