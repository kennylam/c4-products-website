## Anatomy

When the global search bar is clicked on, a dropdown appears.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![ Dropdown (on click)](/images/Dropdown-OnClick.png)

</Column>
</Row>



1. **Type scoping filter:** A list of object types the user has recently viewed
2. **Recent searches:**  A list of recent search keywords and recently visited search results. They are displayed in order of recency. The data is stored in the user's local browser server.

<br/>
<br/>

Recent search keywords are generated when the user hits 'enter' after typing in [keyword].

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![ Dropdown (recent keywords)](/images/Dropdown-RecentKeywords.png)

</Column>
</Row>



1. **Recent search with no scoping filter:** Navigates to the search result page that shows the search results for [keyword]
2. **Recent search with scoping filter:** Navigates to the search result page that shows search results for [keyword], filtered by the selected Type

<br/>
<br/>

Recent search results are generated when the user clicks on a result from the search results or from the suggestions in the dropdown. 
When the result is clicked on, the user is navigated to the object/asset page in a particular service (not the global search result page).

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![ Dropdown (recent results)](/images/Dropdown-RecentResults.png)

</Column>
</Row>


1. **Name of recently viewed result**
2. **Object type**
3. **Breadcrumb**

<br/>
<br/>

## Interaction


When there is overflow, the content must be truncated.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![ Dropdown (truncation)](/images/Dropdown-Truncation.png)

</Column>
</Row>



1. **Recent search keyword truncation:** Truncate the recent search keyword to how much space is available.
2. **Recent search result truncation:** Truncate the recent search result to 40 characters. Truncate the breadcrumbs to how much space is left. 

<br/>
<br/>

When there is no data stored in the user's local browser, display the empty state. This may occur if the user is a first-time user or if the user has cleared their browser storage.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![ Dropdown (no data in browser)](/images/Dropdown-NoBrowserData.png)

</Column>
</Row>


<br/>
<br/>

When the user begins to type into the global search bar, new suggestions with matching keywords appear. 
The list is composed of the exact keyword and suggested search results.

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![ Dropdown (suggestions)](/images/Dropdown-Suggestions.png) 

</Column>
</Row>


1. **Close icon:** Clicking on this icon will clear the search bar. It will not collapse the dropdown.
2. **Exact keyword:** The exact keyword will be displayed at the top of the list. When clicked, navigate to the page that shows results for [keyword].
2. **Suggested search results:** Display the top 7 results of the keyword typed into the search bar. 
The global search API will be used to populate this list. The matched keyword is bolded.

<br/>
<br/>

If there are no matches for the typed keyword, the dropdown will show the keyword typed in the search bar but will not show any recents or suggestions. 

<Row>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={8}>

![ Dropdown (no matches)](/images/Dropdown-NoMatches.png)

</Column>
</Row>


<br/>
<br/>

When a Type scoping filter is selected, the dropdown will display object Types that have a match with the keyword in the search bar. 
The user can select one Type at a time. 

In this example, the user began typing "re" so "Report" is shown because it contains the typed in letters "re."
When selected, the selection appears in the search bar and the other scoping filter options disappear from the dropdown.
Recent searches are also filtered by the selected Type. If the user selects a Type scoping filter and begins to type a [keyword] into the search bar, 
the suggested search results only of the selected Type are displayed.
