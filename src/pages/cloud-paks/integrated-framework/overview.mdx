## Overview

The Cloud Pak brings together teams from different backgrounds and roles to complete their jobs-to-be-done. With the diversity of use-cases, composable experiences are strategic to enabling users with the ability to use only the services they need. Nimble, purpose-driven applications choreographed together make this possible. The IIF is the glue that holds composability together to streamline workflows through smart, contextual integration points. The framework is a comprised of specific components available through Zen to create these seamless experiences across the Cloud Pak, targeting 3 key areas; in-context enrichment, passing information, and seamless navigation.

## In-context enrichment

In-context enrichment is an important facet of integrated experiences as it provides the means for the user to access relevant information from across the platform when they need it, avoiding unneccesary navigation elsewhere. When relevant information is surfaced at the right time within a logical workflow, users feel as if the platform is working harder to keep them on track.

### Panel data fragment enrichment

Through the use of data decorators, an application can provide their point of view to enrich the data itself. The side panel provides a space for data fragments about the data to be displayed directly within the context of the data object.

### Screen influencers

Screen influencers, like tearsheets, enable an experience hosted by another application to be viewed in-context without requiring the user to navigate to that experience elsewhere across the platform.

## Passing information

The integrated interaction framework facilitates the passing of information across composable workflows, enabling the user to run tasks across the platform and to send related information to other applications within their workflow.

### Pass data to from one app to another

Pivot buttons coordinating with platform tearsheets are a common method to pass information. An application can host information and functionality inside a tearsheet, within another application, to capture appropriate information prior to passing it to the hosting application.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>

<Video src="images/pass-information.mov">
  <track kind="captions" src="images/pass-information.mov" />
</Video>

 </Column>
</Row>


### Custom embedded app integrations

Custom integrations take shape based on the experience it supports and can be placed directly within the UI. These are experiences owned and created by the application team. The example shown is a scan functionality from a hosting application that automatically creates a case in another application based on scan results. It then provides the means to navigate directly to the new case.

  <track kind="captions" src="images/custom-integration.mov" />
</Video>

 </Column>
</Row>


### Run app actions from anywhere

Another method to pass data or run actions across the platform is through the use of pivot buttons and confirmation modals. Actions can be run in application A even if a user is viewing application B.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>

<Video src="images/run-actions.mov">
  <track kind="captions" src="images/run-actions.mov" />
</Video>

 </Column>
</Row>

Custom modals can be used as well. For example, a user within the Case Management app can initiate a federated search using another application, Data Explorer, straight from the Case Management UI.

 <Column colLg={8}>

 </Column>
</Row>

## Seamless navigation

Integrated, seamless navigation between applications is key to optimizing and maintaining fluid analysis within a workflow. Strategically placed navigation points within the platform experience promotes forward momentum and sets contextual pivot options for the user to navigate elsewhere across the platform.


### Pivot from one app to another

Itâ€™s often necessary to transition directly from one application to another application to continue a fluid workflow. This example shows a pivot button placed within a side panel. It has a primary action based on the type of data being viewed, but other applications can provide actions to pivot to as well.

Since breadcrumb navigation across the platform reflects the hierarchical structure of an application, the returnTo banner supplements cross-platform navigation pivots with a simple back action as a means to seamlessly way-find back to that previous location on the platform.
