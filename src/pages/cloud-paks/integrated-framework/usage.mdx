 </Column>
</Row>

1. **In-app details:** Information sourced directly from the app the user is within.
2. **Integrated data fragment (optional):** Information related to the subject, sourced from another app(s) or connected data source(s).


## Passing information

Share information, from application to application, across the platform.

### Components


## Seamless navigation

Contextually navigating from one application to another, providing a seamless way-finding experience

### Pivot button

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>

 </Column>
</Row>



1. **Available actions:** Supplementary apps that perform an action or take the user further obtain information about the subject.
2. **Upsell nudge (optional):** Apps that are not available to the user but can perform an action or provide a point of view about the subject.
3. **Default action:** Primary app action for the subject.
4. **Text label:** Indicates what action will occur. The app title should not be included in the text label.
5. **App icon:** Indicates the app where the action will take place or where the user will be taken.

The pivot button can also be placed within the page UI as well. The same behavior and attributes apply as stated in the anatomy.


### ReturnTo banner

The ReturnTo banner is a platform navigation component that displays when a pivot happens from one application page to another application page. The ReturnTo banner can also be used when pivoting from an application page to a platform page (ex: pivoting from an application to connect a data source). It is not a replacement for breadcrumbs but rather it serves to inform when cross-navigating applications occurs with a visible beacon to return to the previous application experience.

<Row>
 <Column colLg={8}>

 </Column>
</Row>

1. **Back arrow:** Indicates backward navigation directly to the previous application page.
2. **Application name:** The name of the application that the pivot was made from.
3. **Page title:** The title of the exact page that the pivot was made from.

#### Cross platform transition

The transition serves to distinguish against conventional navigation within an application. The transition is a usability accompaniment to the ReturnTo banner, unequivocally informing the user when they are pivoting across applications.

#### Usage
- The banner displays the name of the application and the page that was pivoted away from.
- Pressing on the ReturnTo banner will take you back to the page within the original app.
- There should only be one ReturnTo path tracked at a time.
- The banner is only displayed if moving from a pivot point from within the page of an application to another application.
- It is dismissed when navigating back to the platform homepage or using the navigation panel menu to move to another destination.
- The banner is not shown when navigating within the same app.
- Using the global navigation should not reveal the ReturnTo banner.

#### When not to use the banner:
- ðŸš« Not displayed if navigating using the launchbar, global navigation, or platform homepage
- ðŸš« Not displayed if using the breadcrumbs to navigate backwards
- ðŸš« Not displayed if making lateral jumps from platform-level pages
- ðŸš« Not displayed if navigating around within the same application
