  The process for contributing new components and patterns.

</PageDescription>

## Step 1: Submitter drafts an initial document
The designer or design team proposing the new component or pattern drafts a document explaining it. This can just 
be in a boxnote at this stage, but you must follow the relevant template and guidance provided by Carbon: 
- [Guidance for contributing components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/component)
- [Guidance for contributing patterns](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/pattern)
- [Guidance for contributing add-ons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/add-ons)


## Step 2: Create a GitHub issue
Open a new issue in the CD&AI Design PAL [GitHub repo](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal).
This provides everyone with a way of tracking all aspects of the work and feedback in one place.


## Step 3: Present to the Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG)
When a new submission is ready for review, it will be added to the agenda of the next DSAG meeting. 
(The DSAG meets every Thursdays at 11:00EST). Submissions are often (although not always) presented 
by the relevant DSAG rep.


## Step 4: Incorporate feedback from DSAG
Design team to iterate over the designs to address feedback surfaced in the DSAG review. 
Depending on the amount of changes required, the submission might be re-evaluated by the DSAG or it 
might proceed directly to the Design System Implementation Team (DSIT).


## Step 5: Evaluation by the Design System Implementation Team (DSIT)
The refined submission is then evaluated by the Design System Implementation Team (DSIT). 

The DSIT is the leadership group of the broader DSAG. It is comprised of a design leader from each 
of the CD&AI portfolios, as well as other non-product based design leads. 

The final decision about whether or not to publish a new component or pattern to the 
CD&AI Design PAL site is based on factors such as the significance of the gap that the new 
submissions seeks to address, as well as the viability, generality, and implementation of the submission.


## Step 6: Approval and publication

- **Option 1: The component or pattern is approved by DSIT**  
The submitter is asked to prepare the relevant documentation in Markdown so that it can be published 
as an official CD&AI component or pattern on the CD&AI Design PAL site. (The DSAG has experience in this 
process so can assist if needed.)

- **Option 2: The component or pattern is not approved as a universal solution by DSIT**  
In this case the submission might still be documented and published as a product-, Pak-, or platform-specific 
guideline. These are published on the CD&AI Design PAL site, but listed under the relevant 
product, Pak, or platform section of the site navigation.
