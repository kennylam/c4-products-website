  The process for contributing new components and patterns.

</PageDescription>

## Step 1: Submitter drafts an initial document
The designer or design team proposing the new component or pattern drafts a document explaining it. This can just 
be in a boxnote at this stage, but you must follow the relevant template and guidance provided by Carbon: 
- [Guidance for contributing components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/component)
- [Guidance for contributing patterns](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/pattern)
- [Guidance for contributing add-ons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/add-ons)


## Step 2: Create a GitHub issue
Open a new issue in the CD&AI Design PAL [GitHub repo](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal).
This provides everyone with a way of tracking all aspects of the work and feedback in one place. When you open a new issues on Github, please use the New Pattern template relevant to the type of pattern you are submitting (new or enhancement). 


## Step 3: Present to the Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG)
After writing up the guidelines for your pattern, the next step will be to have the Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG) panel 
review your pattern proposal. The typical turnaround time for creating and publishing a pattern to the [CD&AI PAL (https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/) site is about 1 month with 1-2 revisions. Consider how you would like to maintain your pattern once it is published and who from your team will help you maintain it. If you are unable to commit to this timeline, it’s probably not time to submit this pattern just yet. Due to the large volume of work the DSAG panel has to review, it's best to wait to submit your pattern until you have all the necessary material available and are ready to publish. Doing so will help the DSAG panel efficiently critique your pattern and help support you in getting your pattern published.



**Peer review phase 1**

When a new submission is ready for review, it will be added to the agenda of the next DSAG meeting. (The DSAG meets every Thursdays at 11:00EST). Submissions are often (although not always) presented by the relevant DSAG rep. Revisions are made based on feedback given and changes should be incorporated within 1-2 weeks. 

**Peer review phase 2**

After you have incorporated changes and updated your pattern a second review is presented to the DSAG panel. Revisions are made based on feedback given and changes should be incorporated within 1 week.


## Step 4: Evaluation by the Design System Implementation Team (DSIT)
The refined submission is then evaluated by the Design System Implementation Team (DSIT).
The DSIT is the leadership group of the broader DSAG. It is comprised of a design leader from each of the CD&AI portfolios, as well as other non-product based design leads.

The final decision about whether or not to publish a new component or pattern to the CD&AI Design PAL site is based on factors such as the significance of the gap that the new submissions seeks to address, as well as the viability, generality, and implementation of the submission.


## Step 5: Approval and publication

- **Option 1: The component or pattern is approved by DSIT**  
The submitter is asked to prepare the relevant documentation in Markdown so that it can be published 
as an official CD&AI component or pattern on the CD&AI Design PAL site. (The DSAG has experience in this 
process and can assist if needed.)

- **Option 2: The component or pattern is not approved as a universal solution by DSIT**  
In this case the submission might still be documented and published as a product-, Pak-, or platform-specific 
guideline. These are published on the CD&AI Design PAL site, but listed under the relevant 
product, Pak, or platform section of the site navigation. 


**Annual Validation**

Review current published pattern to see if it is still relevant and in need of any updates.
