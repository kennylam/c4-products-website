### What is Carbon for IBM Products and how is it related to Cloud PAL?

Weâ€™re making it easier to find components and patterns created and adopted across all of IBM Software by introducing Carbon for IBM Products: a new site that provides a single place to view guidance for all components, patterns, and resources across Cloud Paks, Cloud Platform, SaaS, and on-premises experiences.

All guidance, patterns, and components found on the Cloud PAL site are now available on Carbon for IBM products for everyone to use.

### What's changing?

We have a new centralized site, that includes access to more patterns, components, and an additional code library.

IBM Cloud Platform, Data & AI, Security, Paks, and IBM Automation designers and developers will be able to go to one place for all available patterns, components, design guidance, and documentation.

### What isn't changing?

Your workflow, communication channels, components and currently used library.

You can begin to use the new site on your own schedule. All IBM Software designers and developers will continue to have access to the solutions you use with no change to your current workflow. None of the code repositories are changing. You can still ask questions in #cloud-pal, but you can also look for advice in #carbon-for-ibm-products. You can continue using the Cloud PAL sketch kit, but we will also be rolling out a new, unified library for both Sketch and Figma.

### Why is this happening?

To ensure awareness, use, and reuse of all available solutions while providing a more consistent Hybrid Cloud experience to our users.
