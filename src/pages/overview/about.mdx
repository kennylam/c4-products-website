A single site for guidance, components, patterns, and resources across IBM Products

</PageDescription>

Carbon for IBM Products is a website that unifies the assets that complement and extend the base <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com">Carbon</a> to components, patterns, and guidelines. Using this site, IBM
developers and designers can increase their visibility and knowledge of existing patterns and components across the IBM
Products org (previously known as Cloud and Cognitive Software), resulting in a more efficient and consistent product
development process.

This representation of products makes up most of IBM software, and the term "Products" distinguishes from digital properties like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/standards/carbon/</a>ibm.com.">Carbon for ibm.com</a>.
