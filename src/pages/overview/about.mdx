A single site for PAL guidance, components, patterns, and resources across IBM Products

</PageDescription>

Carbon for IBM Products is a website that unifies the assets that complement and extend the base <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com">Carbon</a> to components, patterns, and guidelines. Using this site, IBM
developers and designers can increase their visibility and knowledge of existing patterns and components across the IBM
Products org (previously known as Cloud and Cognitive Software), resulting in a more efficient and consistent product
development process.

In the future, Carbon for IBM Products will include resources from even more properties. In addition to IBM Cloud Platform, Cloud Paks, and Security, AI Apps patterns and components will also be hosted here. This representation of products makes up most of IBM software, and the term "Products" distinguishes from digital properties like ibm.com PALs.
