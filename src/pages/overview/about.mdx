About the CD&amp;AI Design pattern asset library.

</PageDescription>

This CD&AI Design pattern asset library is an extension of the <a href=" https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Carbon design system <Launch16 fill="currentColor" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a>. 
It’s a collection of assets that complement and extend the base Carbon components, patterns, and guidelines. 

By making these additional assets available here, we are encouraging **reuse** and **consistency** across 
our CD&AI portfolio.

### Principles for our CD&AI assets
When designing and maintaining our own components and patterns, we follow these principles: 

- Our Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG) provides governance in the use, creation, and promotion of custom components and patterns
- All content aligns with Carbon principles and guidance
- Components and patterns have detailed usage guidelines
- We provide ongoing life cycle management for all of our custom solutions
- Solutions are built in code and made available in our GitHub repo


### Further guidance relevant to a subset of our CD&AI Design org
All CD&AI product teams must follow the Carbon guidelines. In addition to base Carbon, this CD&AI pattern 
asset library provides custom solutions for product teams within our portfolio. 

A subset of CD&AI designers working on particular offerings may also need to reference some additional guidance: 

- Designers working on **Cloud Paks**:
  - see the [Cloud Pak guidance](/cloud-paks/global-search/usage/) section of this site
- Designers delivering offerings onto the **IBM Cloud**:
  - see also the [IBM Cloud PAL](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal/) 
- Designers working on **Watson** offerings:
  - see the [IBM Watson experiences guide](https://www.ibm.com/brand/systems/watson/)
- Designers working on **Security** offerings:
  - see the [IBM Security experience guide](http://security-design-guide.stage1.mybluemix.net/)
