<p style="font-size: 20px">Carbon for Cloud &amp; Cognitive is an extension of the <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/">Carbon design system</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">It’s a collection of assets that complement and extend the base Carbon components, patterns, and guidelines. </p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">By making these additional assets available here, we are encouraging reuse and consistency across the portfolio.</p>

### Principles
When designing and maintaining our own components and patterns, we follow these principles: 

- Our Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG) provides governance in the use, creation, and promotion of custom components and patterns
- All content aligns with Carbon principles and guidance
- Components and patterns have detailed usage guidelines
- We provide ongoing life cycle management for all of our custom solutions
- Solutions are built in code and made available in our GitHub repo


### Further guidance
All product teams across IBM Cloud, Data, AI and Security must follow the Carbon
guidelines. In addition to base Carbon, this Carbon for Cloud & Cognitive library provides
custom solutions for product teams within our portfolio.  

Depending on the offering, product teams may also need to reference some additional
guidance:
