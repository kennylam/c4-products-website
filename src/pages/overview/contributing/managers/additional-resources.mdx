## Understanding the repo

The [IBM Cloud & Cognitive](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive) repository is kept up to date using a Zenhub project board found [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive/issues#workspaces/development-602c6543cd8ba2001cb5ed88/board?repos=272755937).

## Finding issues

You can find issues to work on for your team by navigating to the project board inside of the repo and identifiying which component needs work. Each component has a `tag` which can help you understand in what part of the process it's in. 

#### Tags that imply work is needed:


`Needs dev owner`: This means a component has been completed by a designer but has not yet been worked on by a developer

`Incomplete dev`: This means a component has been started but not finished -- anyone developer is able to pick up and start working on this, <strong>no strings attached</strong>.


#### Tags that give insight into process


`Ready for design review`: This means a developer has completed implementation of the component and needs sign off from design.

`Ready for release review`: This means a developer has completed a component and it needs to be thoroughly tested before publication.
