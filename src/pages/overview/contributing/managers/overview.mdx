## Overview of the contribution process

### 1) Identify a pattern that has not been implemented
To see the current `ibm-cloud-cognitive` project board, click [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive/projects/2). This will allow you to see what's currently in progress.
Alternatively, you can view the issues in the `ibm-cloud-cognitive` [Github repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive/issues) and search for the label `needs: dev owner`.

### 2) Assign yourself to an issue
This gives all contributors in the repo full visibility into which team is working on what.

### 3) Collaborate with pattern owner
A pattern owner should already be assigned to the issue. If no owner is assigned, reach out to UXE Engineering Manager, [Andrea Garcia](https://w3.ibm.com/bluepages/profile.html?uid=4G0746897).

### 4) Deliver code
<br />
<strong>No strings attached. ðŸŽ‰</strong><br />
Delivering code <b>does not</b> make you responsible for maintaining it.<br />
The Cloud & Cognitive FED Guild will maintain components as needed.

### 5) Raise issues when you see them
The Guild will need the community's help to identify bugs. Raising issues is the best way to contribute value to the library, other than delivering code.
Creating a pull request with a fix is the fastest way to get a resolution. You can create a pull request [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive/pulls).
