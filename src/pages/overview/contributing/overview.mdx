## Overview of the contribution process

#### 1) Complete the one-time set-up needed to get your own local build running.
In order to contribute, a local development environment is needed that can access the
git repository, edit the source, run a local build, and display the site in your browser. 
See the [One-time set up](./one-time-set-up) tab for full details.

#### 2) In your local build, make your desired changes and test the output
Now that you have a local development build, you can add/edit/delete content to your heart's content. 
See the [Making and delivering changes](./making-and-delivering-changes) tab for 
full details.

#### 3) Deliver your changes to the `/pal` repo (aka make a "pull request").
Once you are happy with your changes in your local build, it's time to contribute them back to the main 
`/pal` repo. Do this by submitting a "pull request" (PR) and asking a colleague to review it. See 
the [Making and delivering changes](./making-and-delivering-changes) tab for full details.

#### 4) Approved changes get automatically built and deployed to the live site.
When a submitted pull request (PR) is approved and merged, a new Travis build is automatically run, and 
the output is then published to the live site. ðŸŽ‰



## Additional background information

#### Site framework:
This Carbon for Cloud & Cognitive site is based on the [gatsby-theme-carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon) 
website starter, with a few minor enhancements.

#### Website source:
The source files for this  site are held in IBM's internal GitHub Enterprise instance. This means that 
only IBMers can access it. You can access this `/pal` repo here: <https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal/>.

#### File types:
Almost all of the visible page content is written in MDX files (this is a hybrid of Markdown and JSX). 
The good news is that even if you've never heard of Markdown or MDX before, the syntax is really very simple. 
See this external [Markdown basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) page for details.
