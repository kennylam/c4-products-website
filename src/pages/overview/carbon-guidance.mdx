  Providing a consistent CD&amp;AI portfolio approach to using certain Carbon assets

</PageDescription>

There is a degree of variation possible within some of the Carbon components and patterns. As we want 
the CD&AI portfolio to have a high degree of visual and interaction consistency, we have aligned 
on the following options for all CD&AI offerings:

- Re the Carbon [data table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/) component, we do **not** use zebra striping
- Re the Carbon [data table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/) component, we always display the overflow menu
- Re the Carbon [notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/style/) component, we use the low contrast style
- Re the Carbon [UI shell](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-header/usage), our header and left-side rail use the dark theme
- We generally use gray 10 as the background color on all pages (although there are some valid exceptions)
