Providing a consistent IBM Products approach to using certain Carbon assets.

### Carbon for IBM Products core assets

The following core components and patterns are expected to be adopted by the majority of IBM products:

- [About modal](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/about-modal/usage)
- [Cards](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/card/overview)
- [Create flows](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/community/patterns/create-flows/)
- [Empty state](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/empty-state/usage)
- [HTTP errors](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/http-errors/usage)
- [Notifications](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/notifications/usage)
- [Page header](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/page-header/usage)
- [Remove](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/community/patterns/remove-pattern/)
- [Side panel](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/side-panel/usage)
- [Status icons](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/status-icons/usage)
- [User profile images](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/user-profile-images/usage)

See the [Asset index](asset-index) page for a full list of all of our components and patterns.

### Visual and interaction consistency

There is a degree of variation possible within some of the Carbon components and patterns. As we want
the IBM Products portfolio to have a high degree of visual and interaction consistency, we have aligned
on the following options for all our offerings:

[Carbon data table component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/data-table/usage/)

<ul style="margin-top: 0">
  <li>We do not use zebra striping</li>
  <li>We always display the overflow menu</li>
</ul>

[Carbon notification component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/style/)

<ul style="margin-top: 0">
  <li>We use the low contrast style</li>
</ul>

[Carbon UI shell](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-header/usage)

<ul style="margin-top: 0">
  <li>Our header and left-side rail use the dark theme</li>
</ul>

[Background color](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage/)

<ul style="margin-top: 0">
  <li>
    We generally use Gray 10 as the background color on all light theme pages
    (although there are some valid exceptions)
  </li>
  <li>
    We generally use Gray 100 as the background color on all dark theme pages
  </li>
</ul>

[Dialog](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern)

<ul style="margin-top: 0">
  <li>
    To exit or cancel a{" "}
    <a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#passive-modal">
      passive dialog
    </a>
    , we use the "X" icon button.
  </li>
  <li>
    However, for <strong>transactional</strong>, <strong>danger</strong>,{" "}
    <strong>acknowledgment</strong>, and <strong>progress</strong> dialog
    types, we do not use the "X" icon button to exit or cancel.
  </li>
  <li>
    A "Cancel" button should be used to exit or cancel a dialog that requires
    explicit confirmation from the user. It negates the need for a secondary
    exit warning such as "Are you sure you want to cancel this flow?"
  </li>
</ul>
