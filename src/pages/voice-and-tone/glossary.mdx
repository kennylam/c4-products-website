# **A**

### add
Takes an existing object and uses it in a new context (for example, adds an item to the cart, adds 
a user to a group, or adds a document to a folder).  
_Where appropriate, combine add with the object (for example, "add user" or "add role"). 
Compare [create](#create), [insert](#insert), [new](#new), and [upload](#upload)._

### apply
Saves changes without closing the dialog. These properties often affect subsequent system behavior.  
_Use instead of "Save changes". Compare [save](#save)._

### approve
Indicates the user agrees. In a business process, typically initiates the next step.  
_Compare [reject](#reject)._

### artificial intelligence (AI)
A system capable of simulating human intelligence and thought processes. Note that AI is a broad 
field of science that covers many sub-disciplines, including machine learning, visual recognition, 
and natural language processing.  
_The acronym AI is widely understood to refer to artificial intelligence, so do not use this same 
acronym to refer to [augmented intelligence](#augmented-intelligence)._

### assistant
An AI-driven agent with domain knowledge that assists a human user with a task. Assistants may take 
the form of a chatbot or some other interface.

### augmented intelligence
A similar term to artificial intelligence but with more of a focus on AI's assistive role, 
emphasizing the fact that cognitive technology is designed to enhance human intelligence rather than 
replace it.  
_Compare [artificial intelligence](#artificial-intelligence-ai)._


# **B**
_[Back to top](#)_

### back
Returns the user to the previous step in a sequence of steps, such as in a wizard.  
_Use instead of "previous". Compare [next](#next) and [finish](#finish)._

### browse
Assists the user in selecting a file (for example, on a button or link next to an entry field). 
Typically opens a secondary window where the user can locate and select the desired directory and 
file.


# **C**
_[Back to top](#)_

### cancel
Stops the current action and closes the dialog.  
Warn the user of any possible negative consequences of stopping an action from progressing, such as 
data corruption.  
_Compare [reset](#reset)._

### clear
This action clears all the fields or selections. Also deletes the contents of a document, such as a 
log. Typically the default selection or value is re-established for controls that always have a 
selection or value, such as radio buttons.  
_Where appropriate, combine clear with the object (for example, "clear fields" or "clear all"). 
Compare [delete](#delete) and [remove](#remove)._

### close
Closes the current page or window (for example, closing a secondary window containing online help).  
_Do not use close alongside OK or cancel actions. Compare [Cancel](#cancel) and [done](#done)._

### confidence score
In AI contexts, the predicted probability of an answer being correct. This is often a numerical 
expression of certainty shown as a percentage.

### copy
Creates new instances of the selected objects in a specific destination.  
Combine copy with the object being copied (for example, "copy folder") or the destination (for example, 
"copy to clipboard") if there are multiple possibilities.  
_Compare [new](#new)._

### create
Makes a new object from scratch (for example, creates a calendar event or creates a new document).  
_In scenarios where the user needs to supply some details or settings as part of the create process, 
use new to initiate the action and create to apply the user-supplied details or settings to the new 
object. Compare [add](#add), [copy](#copy), [insert](#insert), and [new](#new)._

### customize
Allow a user to make desired changes.


# **D**
_[Back to top](#)_

### delete
Destroys an existing object so that it no longer exists (for example, deletes a file from a 
directory or deletes a value from a table cell).  
_Where appropriate, combine delete with the object (for example, "delete column" or "delete row"). 
Compare [clear](#clear) and [remove](#remove)._

### docs
A commonly used abbreviation for documentation. Typically used as a link that opens a separate window containing the product documentation.  
_Compare [learn more](#learn-more)._

### done

wants to return to where he or she came from.  
_Compare [close](#close) and [finish](#finish)._

### download
Transfers a file from a remote system to a local system.  
_Compare [upload](#upload)._

_Compare [move to trash](#move-to-trash)._

### entity
In AI contexts, a representation of a real-world object (such as a person, location, or bank account), 
used by a machine learning model. For example, in the chatbot utterance: "I’d like to order some tacos 
and beer", the entities would be tacos (food) and beer (drink). Typically, entities are nouns.  
_Compare [intent](#intent)._

### export

body of a document or inserting a record into a table.  
_Compare [add](#new) and [new](#new)._

### insight
In AI contexts, an observation that a machine learning model makes about patterns or unique outliers 
in a set of data. This can be used, for example, to provide current snapshots and predictions of 
customer behaviors and attitudes.

### intent
1) Broadly, the goals, wants, needs, and values of users and businesses. Intent provides your 
solution’s purpose.  
2) In AI contexts, when a chatbot interprets a conversation, it identifies the action or purpose 
behind a user's utterance (usually expressed by the verbs). These are identified as the intents. 
For example, in the utterance: "Where is the bathroom", the intent is to find a location.  
_Compare [entity](#entity)._

where more information follows but does not fit in the current context.  
_If space permits, combine learn more with meaningful text that describes the content you're 
pointing to. For example, if your user needs some best practices to manage apps in multiple regions, 
you could use "Learn more about regions"._

### log in

on the submission button after users enter their credentials.  
_Use instead of "sign in". Compare [log out](#log-out)._

### log out
Exits an application or site.  
_Use instead of "sign out". Compare [log in](#log-in)._

### machine learning (ML)
A subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical 
techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (that is, to progressively improve performance 
on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed.

### model / ML model
In machine learning contexts, a method for performing a function or making a decision by running 
data through a series of mathematical steps, i.e. algorithms. The model represents the steps an 
intelligent machine will take to arrive at a decision.
