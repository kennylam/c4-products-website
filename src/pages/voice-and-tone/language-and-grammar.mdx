## Use standard US English spelling

Quite a few English words are spelled differently in different parts of the world. However, in IBM
we always use US English spelling.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="The artifact is colored gray."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample text="The artefact is coloured grey." aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
</Row>

We can all make typos or forget how to spell a particular word, so always run your UI text through a 
spell checker (e.g. paste your text into a blank Word document and ensure the dictionary is set to US English).

It’s also always worth getting someone else to review your copy before it gets published. If you don't 
have anyone on your product team who you can ask, do put a request out on the [#content_design_guild](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/archives/CAKNY6LSV) 
Slack channel.

- For other words, refer to [Merriam-Webster's online dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)


## Use contractions

Users don't want to read more characters than necessary and we want to present a conversational style.
So do use simple, commonly understood contractions such as _can't_, _don't_, _isn't_, etc.

However, avoid complex contractions that involve combining more than two words (e.g. do not write _wouldn't've_ or _shouldn't've_).

> "Contractions: What's not to like?"

## Use the active voice

In an active voice construction, the subject performs the action (e.g. _Sarah publishes the application_).
In contrast, in a passive voice construction, the target of the action is emphasized (e.g. _The application is published_).

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Product X scans files for viruses before uploading them to the web server."
      caption="Correct use of the active voice."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Files are scanned for viruses and, if cleared, uploaded to the web server."
      caption="Here it's not totally clear who or what scans the files."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

- In general, the active voice is preferable because it emphasizes action and progress.
- The active voice also makes clear who or what is performing the action, which can often be hidden in passive voice constructions.
- Sentences written in the active voice also tend to be shorter than those written in the passive voice.

**Exception:** Using the passive voice is occasionally useful though - such as when you want to avoid blaming the user:

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Error: An incorrect value was entered."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Use simple verb forms

Wherever possible, use simple, single-word verb forms. This makes text easier to understand for all.

For example, avoid using verb phrases when the verb alone will suffice.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Start the monitoring service."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample text="Start up the monitoring service." aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
</Row>


## Use the present tense

There are twelve major verb tenses in the English language, but thankfully, we rarely need to use 
most of these when writing text for our product UIs. In general, write using simple, present tense verbs.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample type="do" text="Message sent" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample text="Your message has been sent" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
</Row>

If you'd like more detail, there are plenty of good online grammar resources, including information 
about [verb forms](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/verbs-basic-forms), 
[verb tenses](https://www.dictionary.com/e/what-are-the-basic-verb-tenses/), and [verb phrases](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/verb-phrases).

## Don't confuse verbs and nouns

Here are a few commonly confused verbs and nouns:

- You might _advise_ (verb) someone on how to do something. They will no doubt be grateful for the _advice_ (noun).
- Network bandwidth will _affect_ (verb) download speeds. An _effect_ (noun) of slow download speeds might be user frustration.
- To _compile_ (verb) the code, do X. After _compilation_ (noun) you can run the code.
- First you need to _install_ (verb) the software. When the _installation_ (noun) completes you will see a welcome screen.
- You might _invite_ (verb) someone to take part in the product beta. This might involve sending them an _invitation_ (noun).



## Use one term per concept

Don’t use different terms (or variations of the same term) to refer to the same thing.
If you use _app_ and _application_ or _repo_ and _repository_ in the same context, a user might well start to question whether you are referring to one thing or to two separate things.

Also, avoid overloading one term with different meanings. If a certain component or process or concept is called one thing,
avoid using this same term to mean anything else. This might sound blindingly obvious, but is, sadly, all too common.

> “A synonym is a word you use when you can’t spell the other one.”

## Phrases vs full sentences

It's fine to use phrases (as opposed to full sentences) in appropriate contexts, such as for headings, button labels, confirmation messages, etc.

Page headings are a good example of where it's preferable to use short, sharp phrases (without periods) rather than full sentences.

Use your judgement as to whether phrases or full sentences are most appropriate in your product context - and then be consistent.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample type="do" text="Remove photo?" aspectRatio="1:1" />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Are you sure that you want to remove these photos?"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## The use of pronouns

A pronoun is used in place of a noun (e.g. _she_ instead of _Ginni_ or _it_ instead of _the car_). Sounds simple, but be careful not to fall into any of the following pitfalls:

- Don’t use a plural pronoun (_they_, _their_, _theirs_, _them_, or _themselves_) to refer to a singular noun. (While this usage is fairly common, it is grammatically incorrect.)
- Don’t use gender-specific pronouns such as _he_, _him_, _himself_, _his_ or _she_, _her_, _herself_, _hers_ when the gender of the subject is unknown.
- Don’t try to cover both genders by using a construction such as _he/she_, _(s)he_, _him/her_, _his/hers_, etc.
- Don’t use _it_ to refer to a person.

So what's ~~a guy~~ ~~a girl~~ one to do?

- You can use the [imperative mood](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/imperative-clauses-be-quiet) (e.g. "Print document") to avoid needing a pronoun at all.
- Use a second person pronoun: _you_, _your_, _yours_, or _yourself_.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Use the Publish wizard to deploy the application."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="You can now deploy your application."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

> When I was a kid, my teacher looked my way and said, “Name two pronouns.” I said, “Who, me?”

## The use of non-English words

You may think it _très chic_ to scatter a few foreign words and phrases into your copy, but is this really a good idea? _Au contraire, mon amie!_

In general, avoid using foreign (i.e. non-English) words and phrases as these increase the complexity of our text and can make us look a little pretentious. _Sacré bleu!_

Exceptions:
Feel free to use the following commonly used Latin abbreviations:

- i.e. (meaning _that is_ or _in other words_)
- e.g. (meaning _for example_)
- etc. (meaning _and so on_)

## Avoid jargon

We need to speak the language that our users speak. Most real people don’t speak in technical or business jargon and neither should we.

Jargon can take different forms:

- The use of specialist terms, not widely understood outside of a narrow field or discipline (e.g. _unquiesce the database_).
- Taking common words but applying them to new contexts, or using them to mean something different from how those words are widely used and understood
  (e.g. _socialize the report_; _massage the data points_).
- Making use of figurative language (e.g. _touch base_; _cherry pick any quick wins_; _drink your own champagne_).

Also, avoid cliches like the plague.\*

| drive                | Don't use in the abstract sense of driving change, etc. Use a more concrete verb such as _control_, _manage_, or _increase_. |
| facilitate           | Don’t use in an abstract sense such as to facilitate progress. Instead, say something specific about how you are helping.    |
| going forward        | Use _in future_ or a similar, more concrete phrase.                                                                          |
| monetize             | Re-word if possible to use more natural language, such as _chargeable_ or _paid plans_, etc.                                 |
| no holds barred      | If there are no restrictions, it is clearer to write something such as _without restrictions_.                               |

| religion / religious | Don’t use to refer to a person or group taking a particular stance or approach to something.                                 |
| sea change           | Simplify to _change_ or, if further emphasis is needed, _significant change_.                                                |
| socialize            | You might socialize with friends after work, but you _publish_ or _share_ a report.                                          |
