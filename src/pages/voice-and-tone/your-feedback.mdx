The aim of this voice and tone guide is to help you write engaging and consistent copy.

The guidance continues to be developed and refined, based on input from many product teams. In fact, 
we have plans to provide additional guidance on the following topics in the coming weeks: 
- headings and sub-headings
- breadcrumbs
- Cloud PAK specific guidance
- expanding the terms covered in the [Glossary](glossary)

If you have a content-related question, suggestion, or just want to provide some feedback to us, 
please do raise an issue in our 
[GitHub repo](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/CDAI-design-website/issues).
