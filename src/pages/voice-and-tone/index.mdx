## Words matter

How we say things is often just as important as what we say. We want our Cloud, Data & AI products 
to express some personality, and the voice and tone we use 
in our written material is key to creating this personality.

When we consistently use a particular voice and tone, people will tend to associate certain qualities 
with us. Consistent voice and tone are crucial for connecting and resonating with users. 

What's the difference between voice and tone? One way to think about it is that voice is always 
consistent, but tone often changes depending on context.

### Voice

Voice is the foundation for communicating about IBM products and delivering brand messages. At IBM, 
our voice expresses the core of our personality, while bringing comfort, ease, and a sense of 
connection to our users. Through careful use of the IBM voice, we help empower users to meet their 
business goals.

### Tone

Tone conveys an attitude toward both the subject matter and the reader. All content – whether it's 
introductory text in the UI, an error message, or a topic in the docs – tells part of a bigger story. 
Good storytellers are skilled in two main areas: what they are saying (the substantive content) 
and how to say it to any given audience (the style and tone in which it is presented). 
Be a good storyteller.


## Who this guide is for
While everyone at IBM is most welcome to use this voice and tone guide, it was principally written 
by and for the Cloud, Data & AI Design org. This org covers the following product portfolios:
- Blockchain
- Business Analytics
- Cloud Integration
- Cloud Platform
- Information Management
- Watson AI


## A guide, not a ball and chain
Like our other design system resources, the intent is for this guide to become part of our shared 
vocabulary, helping us sustain a level of flair and consistency across all that we do.

As such, this voice and tone guide provides us with a common starting point. It helps set some 
practical parameters to keep us consistent, but there is still plenty of scope for creativity. 
As designers, our primary aim is to delight our users, not to comply with a long list of rules. 
So this is a guide, not a ball and chain.

## We need you
We want this guide to be useful and to be used. So please do help us to help you.

So, if you have a question or concern or suggestion about how we could further improve the guide, 
please do get in touch and give us [your feedback](your-feedback). 

We look forward to hearing from you.
