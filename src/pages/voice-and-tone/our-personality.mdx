> "It's not what you say, but how you say it."


Within this guide you’ll find specific advice about various aspects of writing, but spanning all of 
the guidance is a particular voice and tone profile. This speaks of who we are and what we’re about 
and defines how we seek to communicate with our users.

The following factors informed our voice and tone profile:
- IBM's core values
- Content trends in the broader industry
- Input from CD&AI designers, including a workgroup, surveys, and a voice and tone design jam

If we had to summarize our profile in just a few brief words, we’d want to highlight the following 
characteristics:

  <AnchorLink>Engaging</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Helpful</AnchorLink>
  <AnchorLink>Conversational</AnchorLink>

Let’s break these down a little further.

- appealing - speaks directly to our users and focuses on what’s important to them
- inspiring - highlights what can be achieved and bolsters confidence
- confident - comes across as intelligent and well informed; inspires trust
- charming - conveys a likeable personality

_Examples:_
