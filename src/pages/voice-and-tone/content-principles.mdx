## Show don't tell

The layout, flow, visual design, and microinteractions used in our UIs should all help inform people about how to use our products.
Obviously text has a role to play too, but the presence of lots of explanatory text in a UI should prompt the question:
Is there a better way of conveying this information to the user?

Consider using examples, images, or videos rather than large blocks of text.

## Focus on user action

Like everything we produce, our written content should focus on bringing value to the user.
In general, begin with the user goal (the what), then state how to achieve it.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="To add a node into your flow, drag the node icon onto the canvas."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Speak directly to the user

In general, speak directly to the user.
Much of the time this will result in using the second person pronoun ("you").
When appropriate, use the user's name.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Welcome back, Jack. Tip: You can create a copy of an existing flow and use it as the starting point for a new flow."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Be clear but concise

Only cover what is really essential for the user to know. Omit common introductory phrases such as ‘you must,’ ‘due to the fact that’, ‘in order to’, etc.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Save changes?"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="Would you like to save changes?"
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>
Remember that you can make supplementary information available via an expandable section, a tooltip, or a “more information” type link.

## Use simple words

The terminology we use can have a huge impact on the usability of a product, so give this careful consideration.

- ~~In as far as is humanly possible, endeavor to avoid verboseness and tautology in your written communication.~~
  Use simple, clear, direct language.
- See the [Glossary](/guidelines/content/glossary) for common UI terms and action labels
- Don't invent words or apply new meanings to standard words. This way lies confusion.
- Know your user and ask yourself what terms and phrases they use then carry out user research to verify the suitability of these terms.
- When you have determined key terms, use them consistently. Don’t use different terms (or variations of the same term) to refer to the same thing.
- Don’t use complex or lengthy words where simpler, shorter equivalents are available.

Some examples:

| Avoid complex words and phrases | Use simpler alternatives |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| additional                      | extra                    |
| assist                          | help                     |
| commence                        | start                    |
| execute                         | run                      |
| initiate                        | start                    |
| in order to                     | to                       |
| in the event of                 | if                       |
| leverage                        | use                      |
| prior to                        | before                   |
| purchase                        | buy                      |
| terminate                       | end                      |
| utilize                         | use                      |

## Be respectful

Sometimes users do unexpected things and errors can occur, but we should never blame our users in our product messages.
Instead, focus on how the user can fix the problem.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      type="do"
      text="Please check the email address."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
  <Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>
    <DoDontExample
      text="You’ve entered an incorrect email."
      aspectRatio="1:1"
    />
  </Column>
</Row>

## Use short sentences

Remember that people don't tend to read web content, they scan it. This is especially true when people are presented with lots of text.
If your sentence is more than about 25 words long, consider splitting it up.

Similarly, keep any paragraphs short and focused. Within a product UI, paragraphs should be 1-2 sentences in length.
