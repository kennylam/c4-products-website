<PageDescription>

  Step-by-step guides walk users through a specific task from beginning to end.

  As you build out these tours, consider where your users are along their journey. Think of the key tasks they'll need to complete to get to productive use on Day 1 and then any common activities they'll want to complete later on.

## Components

Step-by-step guides should include: 

* Start the tour with a ShoutOut or Popup followed by a series of Smart Walk-Thru Steps and/or Popups
* Tours should be 8 steps or fewer 
* Use popups to reorient the user during a tour or display videos
* End each tour with congratulatory Popup and clear call to action 
* Navigation via action triggers within the UI or buttons 

## Content guidelines

Here are a few things to remember as you're creating your tour: 

1. Avoid tasks that are overly complex or can't be automated through WalkMe. 
2. Don't just tell a user to "click" somewhere without providing context or value.
3. Keep steps short, ensure the messages are direct and actionable, and clearly communicate the end goal.

#### Component guidance 

Opening ShoutOut or Popup
* Use welcoming, encouraging language (Think of yourself as the best tour guide ever!) 
* Describe the task that they'll complete and what they'll learn along the way 
* Always offer the option to close/return to the player 

Steps: 
* Provide clear and precise direction
* If the step is simple, include the purpose or result of the action and omit body text
* If including body text, avoid redundancy and only use this text to describe the value of the action the user is taking or provide additional context

Popups (Optional) 
* Use popups to orient the user if they have moved to a new part of the UI or will be starting a new task
* If you embed a video within the popup, make sure the title clear and the description speaks directly to what the user will see in the video 

Closing Popup: 
* Congratulate the user for completing the task
* If applicable, encourage the user to move on to the next tour in the sequence, suggest another tour or point out additional resource
