## What is WalkMe?

WalkMe is a tool that empowers offering teams to easily onboard and engage with users through capability walkthroughs, guided tours, and product training. WalkMe provides analytics, reporting, and session replays (for both WalkMe and the overall offering), which provides teams the opportunity to gain a comprehensive understanding of offering usage.

WalkMe helps you guide users through critical moments in your offering, and allows you to measure their success doing so.

If you’re interested in building experiences within the WalkMe Editor, your first step is to sign up for WalkMe University. WalkMe University offers online, instructor-led, and blended courses designed to teach you how to use WalkMe.

## Common patterns

You can serve up multiple different types of tours throughout your user's journey. The two most common tours within a getting started experience include: 

* [UI tours](/walkme-guide/overview/ui-tours) that point out specific parts of the UI and help orient new users or highlight new features
* [Step-by-step guides](/walkme-guide/overview/step-by-step-guides) that help a user complete a specific task
