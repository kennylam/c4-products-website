<PageDescription>

Overview patterns help you create a flow that points out specific features or elements within the UI to your users. These patterns can also help you orient new users on the homepage or highlight new features.

## Usage

**Used to**:
- Give a new user some context and value provided by the product
- Highlight the value in context of the UI and where they can access the value

**Not used to**:
- Teach the user how to do something

Best practices
- Point out key features and functions that might be new to your users
- Don’t highlight pieces of the experience that are obvious or “table stakes”
- Keep steps short and make sure you’re highlighting the value to your users, instead of just pointing something out
- At the end of the flow, point out where they can access that experience and others


## Components

Overview patterns should follow this basic structure: 

- Each tour should start with a [Popup](/walkme-guide/smart-walk-thrus/popups) or Carousel followed by a series of [Step Balloons](/walkme-guide/smart-walk-thrus/steps)
- Tours should be **6 visible steps or fewer** not counting the opening and closing Popups
- Include a Popup at the end of the tour. Optionally: provide additional call to action if you want the user to continue to another tour or resource


<br />

### Popups

<Row>
  <Column colLg={10}>

![This is a Popup](images/ThisIsAPopup_Overview-pattern.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

Opening Popups
- Describe what the tour will cover and why it is beneficial to the user
- Use welcoming, encouraging language (Think of yourself as the best tour guide ever!) 
- Offer the user the option to close/return to the player to continue


Closing Popup (optional) 
- Congratulate the user on finishing this tour 
- If applicable, offer a direct call-to-action to additional resources or a follow-up tour

### Carousels

<Row>
  <Column colLg={10}>

  </Column>
</Row>


### Steps (with button)

<Row>
  <Column colLg={10}>

  </Column>
</Row>

- If you're primarily using Step balloons with buttons remember to avoid direct calls to action that might unintentionally diver users and cause drop-off (Example: "Click here to expand the menu")
- Remember to always highlight the value of the feature or function to your user and their jobs to be done
- In this context, questions may be used to frame objective or purpose

### Steps (without button)

<Row>
  <Column colLg={10}>

![This is a Step (without button)](images/ThisIsAStep(NB)_Overview-pattern.png)

  </Column>
</Row>
