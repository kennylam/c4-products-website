<PageDescription>

Popups have multiple uses within a Smart Walk-Thru. You can use them to start and end a tour, or provide additional information that isn’t directly anchored to a specific part of the UI.

In order to implement an effective Popup, you must first determine which [pattern](/walkme-guide/walkme-patterns/overview) your use case falls into. 


Use Cases:
- Warmly welcome a new user to the product
- Give a new user some context and value provided by the product
- Provide additional or background information about a tour 
- Make announcements–like new features or updates
- Provide overall page context without covering the whole UI using corner popups
- Embed videos in tours to provide even more information
- Wrap up and end a tour to give users the next call to action
