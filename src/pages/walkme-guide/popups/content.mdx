## Best practices

- Text should speak to the value of each tour.
- Text should be clear, concise, and speak directly to the user.
- You can consider including links to resources containing additional information (i.e. documentation).
- Limit titles to one line of text, using sentence-style capitalization.
- Limit body text to a maximum of 3 sentences.

_Refer to [Voice and tone](/voice-and-tone/overview/introduction) guidelines for best content implementation_

## When starting a tour

All tours should include a welcome popup that explains exactly what the user will do within a tour. Keep things short and concise, but be sure to highlight the value of this particular feature or action.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

![Starting Popup](/images/Popups_starting_annotated.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):

If you’re using a Popup to kickoff a tour, the header should welcome and speak directly to the user. It should state what they will accomplish within the tour. Pro-tip: The header for this modal can match the Menu title.

#### 2. Body Content (310 characters):

This content should be clear and concise. It should say exactly what the user will accomplish within the tour and the value it will bring.

#### 3. Buttons:
You should give the user two options, to either start a tour or explore the UI on their own.

Popular button labels:

- Primary button: Let’s go!; Start tour
- Tertiary button: Maybe later; Explore on my own

## Popups with videos

You can provide your user with a video within a popup to explain information that may not be possible or as concise with WalkMe alone. For example, if the feature requires your user to leave the product and connect a third-party product where WalkMe cannot be installed, a quick video of how to do that would be the best option. Videos can also give a quick overview of the product itself and give context before your user engages with a tour.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

![Video Popup](/images/Popups_video_annotated.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):
The header should welcome and speak directly to the user. It could be consistent with the title of the video.


#### 2. Body Content (310 characters):
This content should be clear and concise. It should say what the user could expect to see in the video along with what happens next should they choose to skip the video.


#### 3. Video (The video should be 16x9 aspect ratio):
Keep the video as short as possible to increase engagement


#### 4.Buttons:
You can choose to have one or two buttons depending on if there is more after the video for the user to interact with.


## Corner Popups 

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

  </Column>
</Row>


#### 1. Illustration/GIF (optional):
Use illustrations or GIFS to help give your users additional context that helps them understand the UI of your product.


#### 2. Header (optional)


#### 3. Body content:
Use body content to give further tour context or callout what is happening in the UI. Make sure this content is clear and concise.


#### 4. Buttons
- Primary button: Next
- Tertiary button: Done

## When ending a tour

Just like any good story, every tour should have a clear ending. Within a guided tour we recommend using a Popup to congratulate the user and, if applicable, guide them to additional resources or tours.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

![Ending Popup](/images/Popups_ending_annotated.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):
Congratulate the user for completing the tour or task. Remember to be encouraging and engaging.


#### 2. Body Content (310 characters):
This is a good time to give the user a quick summary of what they’ve just walked through and accomplished.
If there were multiple sections of the tour, feel free to list a summary of those sections and what they helped the user to accomplish. If applicable, provide a call to action to the next tour in the sequence or additional resources.


#### 3.Buttons: 
This would be a great time to suggest other tours that the user may want to explore.
- Primary button: Finish; Done
- Tertiary button: Explore more
