<PageDescription>

Like the Carousel, the Journey Selector component must be implemented through the WalkMe editor in the Solutions Gallery. Below you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to implement this component successfully. 

</PageDescription>

Note: Journey Selectors are built using custom Popups that are located within a single Smart Walk-thru. To allow for this pre-built customization, the component is located within the solutions gallery. (If you don't have access, reach out to the [Growth team](/walkme-guide/overview/contacts#additional-contacts).

- Select **Solutions** to enter Solution Gallery

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

  </Column>
</Row>

Once you’re in the gallery, you’ll find different Journey Selector variations under the Shared Solutions header.

- Choose the Journey Selector that fits best with your design. Then select **Use Solution**.

Once you’ve selected your solution you’ll see a folder that populates at the top of your editor list with the name of the Journey Selector you’ve chosen.

- Click on the folder. 

_Remember: The Journey Selector is just a custom styled Popup._

- Within the folder you'll see it populated with a Popup, click to enter the Popup.

You can also copy and paste your image URL directly into the BBcode. (For best results, image sizes should be  32px x 32px )

**Linking tiles to journeys**

- Hover over the trigger area you want to edit (each trigger is linked to an individual tile) until the plus sign appears then hover over the **plus sign**. 

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

**Removing tiles**

If you've made a mistake or simply want to remove the amount of Journeys your offering, follow the steps below. 

- If you have already connected a journey: hover over the connected trigger and select the trashcan icon from the options.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

![implementation-7](/images/JS_implementation-7.png)

  </Column>
</Row> 

- Next, click into the Popup and open the BBcode window from the toolbar. 

In the BBcode window, locate the **[trg][/trg]** tags that correspond to the tile that needs to be removed. Note:  All [trg] tags are individually numbered. 

- Remove all content between the tags including the [trg][/trg] tags themselves. 
- **Save** the bbcode changes.

The preview window should now reflect the removed tile.
