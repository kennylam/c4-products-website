<PageDescription>

  There are four Journey Selector templates you can choose between when you design your WalkMe flows. You can offer your users anywhere from two to ten journeys. The number of journeys you have will determine which journey template you'll choose to implement. Keep in mind the more journeys you offer your users the less supporting text space is available to add in each journey's description.

<br />

## Best practices
- Preface the Journey Selector template with at least one starting Popup.
- Text should speak to the value of each tour. 
- Text should be clear, concise, and speak directly to the user. 
- Avoid saying anything that might sound like sales or marketing.
- Work with your project teams to determine content and autoplay rules.

## Template breakdown

The image below shows the structure of the most detailed Journey Selector component. In the Journey Selector, titles, images, and body texts vary between the different template options.

  </Column>
</Row>

<br />

#### 1. Title
Your title can explain to your users the choices they have in the selections below. This should be clear and concise. 


#### 2. Description
Help your user understand how to proceed (for example: "Choose which scenario interests you the most")


#### 3. Journey tiles
You can offer anywhere from 2-10 Journeys depending on which Journey Selector template you choose.


#### 4. Pictograms
Pictograms should accurately depict the value of the tour. Each tile can have a different pictogram. This option is only available with the two-four tile template.


#### 5. Journey title
Integrated title + description available. (Refer to bottom of page for more information.)


#### 6. Journey description: 
This content should be clear and concise. It should say exactly what the user will accomplish within the tour or the value of a specific feature. Descriptions are not available in the 10 card selection. 


#### Additional buttons 
There are no options for next/dismiss buttons since your user should've confirmed that they wanted to continue on to the Journey Selector component in the previous Popup. If the user wants to exit there is an "x" in the upper right corner.

_The four template variations are shown below. Each template gives you the option to offer different journey amounts. Each template is limited to a particular number of text per tile:_
