  ShoutOuts are Popups that can welcome the user to a product, launch a Smart Walk-Thru tour, or provide a call to action at the end of a tour. ShoutOuts present content that users won't need to re-access from the player later.

Consider how you would like to communicate information to your users. Instead of relying on your user to seek out information that they might not even know exists, ShoutOuts automatically appear and guarantee users see your message. Add an action button to the ShoutOut that provides additional guidance with a Smart Walk-Thru or links out to additional resources. 

## Use cases: 

* Welcome user to the product 
* Launch a tour 
* Present content that users won’t need to re-access later 
* Promote new features 
 
## When to use: 

You can configure ShoutOuts to appear automatically throughout a users' journey or manually from a Launcher or Player. Depending o how you're building the experience, you can start a tour with a ShoutOut instead of a Popup.

## Best practices: 

* Configure and associate segments to ensure the correct users are viewing the ShoutOut based on permissions, roles, and access. Ensure messaging is popping up at the right time, in the right place, and with the right user.
* Use a Launcher to initiate a ShoutOut so it's not as disruptive.
* Carefully determine which content is best suited for a ShoutOut so that users are not inundated by them.
* Work with your project teams to determine content and autoplay rules based on your user goals.
