 ## Best practices

- Tours should be six steps or less (if more is needed, add an additional tour).
- Text should speak to the value of each tour.
- Text should be clear, concise, and speak directly to the user.
- You can consider including links to resources containing additional information (i.e. documentation).
- Limit titles to one line of text, using sentence-style capalization.
- Limit body text to a maximum of 3 sentences.

## Steps with action buttons

Use Steps with action buttons to point out specific parts of the UI. For the most part, these Steps don’t prompt the user to take action within the UI and are triggered by the action button. 

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

  </Column>
</Row>

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):
The header should be action-oriented and geared toward the user. Use words like: Explore, view, find, etc.
- If you are pointing out a specific part of the UI with a clear label, the header should include it
- Keep the tone neutral and limit exclamation points unless they have completed a section or tour

#### 2. Body text:
Keep a conversational tone but always be clear and concise.
- Avoid more direct calls to action that might unintentionally divert users and cause drop-off (For example: “Click here to expand the menu”)
- Avoid using terms like “click” without explaining to the user why they are selecting that option. This prevents the user from unintentionally exiting the tour.


## Steps without action buttons

Use these Steps to instruct your users to take a direct action within the UI. These steps are triggered by actions within the UI.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

  </Column>
</Row>

#### 1. Header (Max. 55 characters):
Clearly state what the user is about to do or accomplish

#### 2. Body content:
- Use “select” instead of “click here” if there are multiple options for the user to choose from.
- Use “navigate to” if there is a drop down menu the user needs to click before getting to their destination.
- Add tips in this section if there is useful information that can help the user do something better or faster.
- If your user is about to navigate to a new page, tell them why they are going there and how it will help them.

## Steps with illustrations/GIFS

Steps with illustrations/GIFs can appear in both templates—with or without the action buttons. Use illustrations or GIFs to add value to what you’re explaining in the body text or to help the user understand how to navigate and / or interact with the UI. These are especially helpful when explaining complex interactions. For example, the drag and drop.

<Row>
  <Column colLg={8}>

![Steps with illustration](/images/Steps_withIllustration_annotated.png)

  </Column>
</Row>


#### 1. Illustrations/GIFs:
Use illustrations and GIFs to help your user understand more complex interactions like the ‘drag and drop’. You can also use illustrations and GIFs to provide extra context to what you are explaining with your body text and header.
- Keep GIFS short and to the point
- Save illustrations and GIFs to your WalkMe Assets Library in the WalkMe editor

#### 2. Close button:
When your illustration or GIF has similar colors to the close button, you can change the button to an alternate version that has a gray opacity behind the “x”.
