<PageDescription>

Our design system thrives when designers and developers contribute their assets to benefit everyone. This contribution mindset framework provides methods and tools that help create and share new assets. The guidance covers the end-to-end process, from initial research to the design, development, and contribution phases.

## The mindset

When you are planning on creating a new asset, it's best to start with the mindset that it will be used not only by your product but also contributed to Carbon for IBM Products for others to benefit from.

A common mistake is to put off thinking about the possibility of contributing the new asset until after it has been designed and developed. By adopting a contribution mindset from the outset, you will likely save yourself a lot of work in the long run.

By adopting a contribution mindset, custom assets can be designed, developed, and shared via our design system much more easily and quickly.

## The framework

The contribution framework is a series of activities that help teams produce new assets that are consistent with our other assets and standards. There are four sections in the framework:

<Row>
  <Column colSm={2} colMd={4} colLg={3} noGutterSmLeft noGutterMdLeft noGutterLgLeft>
    <StepCard
      title="Intent"

      Focus on user empathy by defining clear pain points and problem statements, along with a to-be scenario

  <ExpressiveOverviewCard title="Consistency">
Delivering a seamless user experience across products to our customers.
  </ExpressiveOverviewCard>
  <ExpressiveOverviewCard title="Contribution">
Non-standard assets that aren't contributed to our shared design system lead to inefficiencies as others often go on to create similar assets. And if similar assets are created and shared, your team might well have to adopt those in the future.
