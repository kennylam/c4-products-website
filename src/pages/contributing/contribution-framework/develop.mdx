Now that the design is finalized and approved, it’s time to bring this asset to life and deliver it into your user’s hands!

#### Account for modularity

To ensure your team’s asset can later be shared with other products and organizations, it is important to develop it in an isolated way.
<br />
If you’re new to this approach, get familiar with the contribution guidelines and coding style guides of the Carbon Design System as well as Carbon for IBM Products. The stricter you follow these standards, the easier it will be to integrate your work in the greater component and pattern library and the easier it will be for you to consume and tweak assets shared by others.

#### Playback to design

Once the implementation is stable and meets all acceptance criteria, it’s time for Design to review the component to make sure it matches the intended user experience and visual design.
<br />
This is also the stage at which your team should verify the component supports the expected keyboard navigation, is screen reader compatible and doesn't violate any other accessibility standards nor the HTML specification.

#### Evaluate your asset in production

Before submitting the asset to the pattern and asset library, try implementing it in your product and using it in the intended context.This way you can catch any last-minute issues. For more guidance on the topics below, follow links in step 1.
<br />

##### Practices

<EnumerationCards kind="checklist">
  <li>
    Does your component accept a ref (if not, should it)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Does your component accept any additional attributes and where are they emitted?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are all styles imported correctly and are there any unexpected overrides by external selectors with higher specificity?
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

##### Generalization

<EnumerationCards kind="checklist">
  <li>
    Is your component truly isolated (doesn’t have any new or product-specific dependencies)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are you using slots for customizable content?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are your styles suitably prefixed with a variable (not hardcoded)?
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

##### Carbon

<EnumerationCards kind="checklist">
  <li>
    Is your component using Carbon color and spacing tokens instead of hardcoded values?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is your component using Carbon’s mixins for fonts, motion, breakpoint and helpers (such as focus styles)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is your API Consistent with what one would expect from a Carbon asset?
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

##### Accessibility

<EnumerationCards kind="checklist">
  <li>
    Is your component built with the proper, semantic HTML tags?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are you using correct ARIA tags, where needed?
  </li>
  <li>
    Are interactive elements in the tab order (and are all tab indices either -1 or 0)?
  </li>
  <li>
    Did you verify your component with the IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can your asset be used with keyboard only?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is your component announced correctly by screen readers?
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

##### Documentation

<EnumerationCards kind="checklist">
  <li>
    Did you define all prop types?
  </li>
  <li>
    Is there at least one “Playground” (fully customizable) story for the PAL’s storybook?
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>
