<PageDescription>

This is the phase where design and code iteration can officially commence, with the two disciplines collaborating closely on the look and feel of the new asset.

#### Low-mid-fi design playback

#### For designers

Now that the designer has a good grasp on the purpose of the asset, they can iterate on the design of it.

<EnumerationCards color="cyan10">
  <li>
    Verify with development that data and information utilized within your asset is available.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask development if there might be any limitations on implementing the designs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sync with your development colleague before the official playback meeting.
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

#### For developers

In each playback by Design the questions or concerns from the previous playback should be answered / addressed.

<EnumerationCards color="green10">
  <li>
    Discuss with Design which parts (if any) of the asset are already finalized, and wont change dramatically in the near future.
  </li>
  <li>
    Start implementing the structure of the asset while details like spacing or content is still in the works.
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

<ExpressiveListContainer title="Step 2" text={

#### Second feedback meeting with DSAG

After you've incorporated the feedback from your first DSAG meeting, you'll be ready to schedule a second review with the DSAG team.

<EnumerationCards>
  <li>
    <strong>Update content in GitHub issues</strong>
    Make sure that the two GitHub issues that you’ve created (Scope, Step 3) are up to date.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Schedule a spot in the DSAG meeting schedule</strong>
    Reach out to <a href="../../overview/contacts">your DSAG representative</a> to schedule a second review.
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

</>
} />

<ExpressiveListContainer title="Step 3" text={
<>

#### Submit asset concept for DSIT review

The refined submission is then evaluated by the Design System Implementation Team (DSIT). The DSIT is the leadership group of the broader DSAG. It is comprised of a design leader from each of the Cloud & Cognitive portfolios, as well as other non-product based design leads.
<br />
The final decision about whether or not to publish a new asset or pattern to the Carbon for IBM Products site is based on factors such as the significance of the gap that the new submissions seeks to address, as well as the viability, generality, and implementation of the submission.
<br /><br />
The submitter is asked to prepare the relevant documentation in Markdown so that it can be published as an official component or pattern on the Carbon for IBM Products site.
<br /><br />
The submitter will also need to raise an issue in the carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive repo, which our UX Engineering colleagues use to plan and track their work.
<br /><br />
Schedule another meeting with DSIT, if feedback was given during the first meeting.

<EnumerationCards>
  <li>
    <strong>Add documentation</strong>
    Create a new pull request (PR) for approval and merging of your new asset to the pattern asset library.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Schedule a spot in the DSIT meeting schedule</strong>
    Reach out to <a href="../../overview/contacts">your DSIT representative</a> to schedule a spot on an upcoming meeting.
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

</>
} />

<ExpressiveListContainer title="Step 4" text={

#### Finalize the asset

#### For designers

After attaining DSIT’s approval, it’s time to prepare the asset for the high-fi stage, and share it with the development team.

<EnumerationCards color="cyan10">
  <li>
    Follow the standard guides regarding grid, responsive design, theming, spacing, layout, accessibility, typography, color and globalization principles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare a mockup of the content, for the final internal review between design and development.
  </li>
</EnumerationCards>

#### For developers

Consider the last playback with design as sign-off on both sides, that the component fulfills all user requirements and can be implemented accessibly. It is okay to request and receive minor changes past this point but the overarching structure and aspects of the component should be stable enough to last.
