## Overview of the contribution process

### 1) Identify a pattern that has not been implemented
The [Carbon for IBM Products](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive) repository is kept up to date using a ZenHub project board found [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive/issues#workspaces/development-602c6543cd8ba2001cb5ed88/board?repos=272755937).

<InlineNotification kind="info">

You <strong>must</strong> have the ZenHub extension on your browser to view this project board. See the [Zenhub for Github documentation](https://www.zenhub.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=P%20-%20Search%20-%20Brand&utm_term=zenhub&utm_content=&hsa_acc=8479887336&hsa_cam=10773952283&hsa_grp=105770836683&hsa_ad=454694631793&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-347084789249&hsa_kw=zenhub&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQiAst2BBhDJARIsAGo2ldUySzDtmlvAlrmhyGbmYfEqGfxXR7ttauzQ_N72xUDI6GDMej2W1x0aAvLoEALw_wcB) to download the extension. Once downloaded, you can navigate back to the repo in GitHub and refresh the page to access the board.

Find issues to work on for your team by navigating to the project board inside of the repo and identifiying which component needs work. 

Each component has a `tag` which can help you understand in what part of the process it's in. 

#### Tags that imply work is needed:


`Needs dev owner`: This means a component has been completed by a designer but has not yet been worked on by a developer.

`Incomplete dev`: This means a component has been started but not finished -- any developer is able to pick up and start working on this, <strong>no strings attached</strong>.


#### Tags that give insight into process


`Ready for design review`: This means a developer has completed implementation of the component and needs sign off from design.

`Ready for release review`: This means a developer has completed a component and it needs to be thoroughly tested before publication.


### 2) Assign yourself to an issue
This gives all contributors in the repo full visibility into which team is working on what.

### 3) Collaborate with pattern owner
A pattern owner should already be assigned to the issue. If no owner is assigned, reach out to:

- [Elysia Hwang](https://w3.ibm.com/bluepages/profile.html?uid=0J1435897), UX Engineering Manager, or 
- [Carrie Lloyd](https://w3.ibm.com/bluepages/profile.html?uid=2D1739897), Design Lead

### 4) Deliver code
<br />
<strong>No strings attached. ðŸŽ‰</strong><br />
Delivering code <b>does not</b> make you responsible for maintaining it.<br />
The Carbon for IBM Products FED Guild will maintain components as needed.

Review and follow the repo's contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

### 5) Raise issues when you see them
The Guild will need the community's help to identify bugs. Raising issues is the best way to contribute value to the library, other than delivering code.
Creating a pull request with a fix is the fastest way to get a resolution. You can create a pull request [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-cloud-cognitive/pulls).
