  The process for contributing new components and patterns.

</PageDescription>

## Step 1: Draft document
The design team proposing the new component or pattern drafts a document explaining it. This can just 
be in a boxnote at this stage, but you must follow the relevant template and guidance provided by Carbon: 
- [Contributing components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/component)
- [Contributing patterns](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/pattern)
- [Contributing add-ons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/how-to-contribute/add-ons)


## Step 2: Open GitHub issue
Open a new issue in the CD&AI Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG) [GitHub repo](https://github.ibm.com/CloudIntegrationDesign/DesignSystemAdoptionGuild).

`TW: Is this to alert the DSAG about the potential new component / pattern?`


## Step 3: Present to the Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG)
Design team presents pattern/component to the DSAG (Thursdays at 11:00EST)

`TW: Presumably the DSAG find a slot in their mtg agendas and then invite the proposer to a specific mtg instance?`


## Step 4: Incorporate feedback from DSAG
Design team to iterate/address feedback surfaced in DSAG review

`TW: It looks like there is a submission step missing here?  - e.g. should this step have a second sentence that says "When ready, the design team re-submit the component / pattern by updating the open GitHub issue"?`


## Step 5: Evaluation of working code by the Design System Implementation Team (DSIT)
Submission is evaluated by Design System Implementation Team (DSIT)

`TW It might be worth briefly explaining what the DSIT is and how this step differs from step 3, where it was the DSAG who were evaluating  Is it that step 3 was more an evaluation of the general idea / design, and this step is now an evaluation of the working code implementation?`


## Step 6: Approval and publication
Option 1: Pattern/component is approved by DSIT
New submission is formatted in markdown and published to the CD&AI PAL site

`TW: Who does this?`


Option 2: Pattern/component is not approved as a universal solution by DSIT
Item is documented as a guideline, specific to the submitting product/pak/platform and is added to that area's documentation

`TW: Do you mean, within the PAL site? Or somewhere else?`
