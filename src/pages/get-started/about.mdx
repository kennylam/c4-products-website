About the Common Pattern and Asset Library.

</PageDescription>

The **CD&AI Common Pattern Asset Library** is an extension of the <a href=" https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Carbon design system <Launch16 fill="currentColor" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 2px 2px 0"/></a>. 
It's a collection of assets that complement and extend the base Carbon components, patterns, and guidelines. 
By making these additional assets available here, we are encouraging reuse and consistency across our products.




The Pattern and Asset Library will:
* Ensure all content aligns with Carbon principles and guidance
* Maintain custom patterns outside of core Carbon
* Provide component and pattern usage guidelines
* Provide life cycle management for all custom solutions
* Provide governance in the use, creation, and promotion of custom components and patterns
* Provide a code repository for all custom solutions


Under the generic guidelines, components, and patterns you will find some product specific design guidelines. 
These provide guidance for specific product contexts and collections (e.g. IBM Cloud Platform and IBM Cloud Paks).
