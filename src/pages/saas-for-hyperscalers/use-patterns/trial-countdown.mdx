### Trial ending

**Trial ending** state is activated when the user's Try experience will expire in a number of days. The border around the Try countdown changes from the gradient to the `Red 50` stroke. The user is also notified of the approaching Try expiration by a UI login message and an automated email. 

## Toggletip

- When the user clicks on the Try countdown, the [toggletip](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/toggletip/usage/) displays the Try expiration date.
- When the user clicks away from it, the toggletip content is hidden.
- Toggletip content can be configured based on your product strategy, such as to prompt a purchase or upgrade.
- Clear purchase or upgrade messaging and methods should be included in the Toggletip area.
