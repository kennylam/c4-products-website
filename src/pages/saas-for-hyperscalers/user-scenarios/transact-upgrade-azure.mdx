  </Column>
</Row>

A ** direct link to sign up for the IBM SaaS product's free trial ** is provided on the product details page in the Azure Marketplace listing. Users can ** access to the trial without the need of going through any transaction in Azure. ** When they are ready to upgrade, the user completes the subscription process on the Azure Portal. When they log in to the software again with the same IBMid created during the trial sign up process, the ** trial instance will be upgraded automatically to the paid service ** and the user can continue to use the product.

## Test drive and buy public offer on Azure

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

  </Column>
</Row>

Test drive is ** an assigned, time-bound environment ** that allows potential customers to try out the key features of a product **without the need to create an IBM account**. The user can test drive by clicking on a CTA button on the product details page on the Azure Marketplace and give their consent to sharing their information with IBM. When they are ready to upgrade, the user completes the subscription process on the Azure Portal. They will set up the IBM account and ** a new paid service instance will be provisioned. ** They can then start using the product.
