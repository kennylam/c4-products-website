Although there are a few different channels at IBM where a user can find and explore our product offerings, the **typical journey starts from the product marketing page on IBM.com**. The user learns about the product features and the SaaS offering availability on the hyperscaler cloud providers, and registers for the **trial that is provisioned on a selected hyperscaler, like AWS or Azure**. 

When they are ready to buy, the user can purchase a paid subscription through the hyperscaler Marketplace. Once the transaction is complete, a button is provided to the user to setup the account (IBM account). The system will recognize the presence of the trial instance and upgrade the instance automatically if the user signs in with the same IBMid as the one used for setting up the trial.

When the user is ready to buy, they can also work with an IBM seller to get a custom offer that better meets their needs. See [Custom offer via IBM Sales](https://pages.github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/cpp-foundation-microsite/saas-for-hyperscalers/user-scenarios/private-offer) for details.
