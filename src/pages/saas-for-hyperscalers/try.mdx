## Types of trial

To help the potential customer to evaluate the product against their business needs and use cases, different types of trial can be considered to provide the best experience when interacting with IBM.

### Product trial

A free product trial can be time-bound or with other usage limits other than time. It allows users to gain full product access up to the limit set forth in the trial terms (e.g. 30 days or storage up to 25GB/month). Users can choose to upgrade from a trial to a paid service through the same hyperscaler platform where they have launched the trial sign-up process in the first place.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![time-bound trial](images/TimeBoundTrial.png)

  </Column>
</Row> 

If trial is time-bound, a [trial period count down widget](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/cloud-paks/trial-countdown/usage/) is displayed in the global header 

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![time-bound trial](images/NonTimeBoundTrial.png)
If trial is not time-bound, a Buy button is displayed in the global header

  </Column>
</Row>

### Test drive

(Available as an option on Azure Marketplace)
Test drive is an assigned, pre-configured environment that allowed users to try out the key features of the product without the need of signing up for an account. Once a test drive instance is assigned, it is available for use by that customer for a set period. After the period has ended, the instance will be deleted and user will no longer have access. User will be contacted through email with links for further information and action.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={6} colLg={6}>

![time-bound trial](images/TestDrive.png)
Access Test Drive from Azure Marketplace

  </Column>
</Row>

## Launch points

User can sign up for the SaaS product trial through the different product marketing channels, such as IBM.com, AWS Marketplace, and Azure Marketplace

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

** IBM.com **
![time-bound trial](images/IBM-marketing.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

** AWS Marketplace **
![time-bound trial](images/ProductDetails1.png)
When user clicks on the "Try for Free" button in AWS product listing, they need to sign into their AWS Marketplace account first and create a $0 contract through AWS. At the end of the transaction, they will be provided a link to configure their account with IBM. See the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-saas-products.html#saas-free-trials-for-contracts">documentation on AWS Marketplace</a> for details

  </Column>
</Row>

## URX and IBMid

Before user can access an IBM SaaS product or a product trial, user must first be authenticated with IBMid. User can create a new IBMid using the standard URX (Unified Registration Experience) form.

The URX form collects and validate the user's account information, and record the user's consensus in email communication, data privacy policy, and product terms and conditions. This form should not be modified by individual product teams. However, on the URX form page, there is a configurable panel that can be used to provide product specific information.

The URX form used for SaaS product trail sign up should use the following template:

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![time-bound trial](images/URX-anatomy.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

1. **Sign up for IBMid form (not customizable)**
2. **Product trial sign up panel (customizable):** Product team can customize the contents in this panel
3. **Product icon:** Application icon should be used
4. **Product name**
5. **Sub-headline:** "Start your x-day trial"
6. **Hyperscaler cloud provider logo:** This logo should be displayed if the user launches the sign up flow from one of the hyperscaler marketplaces.
7. **Product highlight:** Concise product highlight that helps reinforce user's trial signup decision



## IBMid log in (URX form)

This flow allows users to access their product or Try experience and applies to non-IBM Cloud products provisioned through IBM. 

### User encounters log in screen

The user is prompted to enter their IBMid/ email address. The user can either manually enter this information or utilize browser autofill functionalities. 

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![URX Login Screen 1](images/URX-Login/URX-Login-Screen-1.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

1. **Create an IBMid link:** Directs user to the IBMid account creation form (URX)
2. **Existing IBMid field** 
3. **Continue button:** Remains disabled until IBMid has been entered and validated
4. **Remember IBMid:** User can optionally select for their browser to remember their IBMid faster login in the future
5. **Forgot IBMid link**  
6. **Support link**

### Email validation and password field

The system verifies that the email address is registered to an IBMid. Once validated, the user is presented with a field to enter their password. 

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![URX Login Screen 4](images/URX-Login/URX-Login-Screen-4.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

1. **Load indicator:** Replaces the Continue button once clicked before loading the password screen

<br></br>

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

2. **Password field** 
3. **Log in button:** Remains disabled until password has been entered 
4. ** Forgot password link:** Allows user to reset their password


### User enters their password and logs in

The user may manually enter their account password or utilize their browser’s saved password autofill functionality. Once submitted, their password is validated and the user is logged in to their account.

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![URX Login Screen 8](images/URX-Login/URX-Login-Screen-8.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

1. **Load indicator:** Replaces the Log in button once clicked before redirecting the user into the product or Try experience 



## URX Sandbox Trial, Trial, and Freemium registration flow

This flow allows users to sign up for a Sandbox Trial, Trial, or Freemium account for products that are provisioned on IBM Marketplace and are not IBM Cloud products. In signing up for a Try experience, users will be creating an IBMid (unless they already have one).

### Navigating to the Try experience sign-up page

There are multiple ways a user can navigate to a Try experience registration form. The most common is from the marketing site, where users can click on a CTA on the homepage, navigation, or interior site pages.

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**Note:** Users cannot access the URX registration form via the IBM Cloud Catalog because the Cloud Catalog only includes products that are provisioned on IBM Cloud. If this is the case, its Try experience would be registered via the IBM Cloud registration form (pattern coming soon).

</InlineNotification>

<Row>
  <Column colMd={8} colLg={10}>

![URX Sandbox Trial Freemium CTA Screen](images/URX-Sandbox-Trial-Freemium-Registration/URX-Sandbox-Trial-Freemium-CTA-Screen.png)

  </Column>
</Row>

### Registration process

There are three unique scenarios for the first step which are dependent on whether the user already has an IBMid or needs to create one. 

1. Users without an IBMid can enter the account information and create a new IBMid.

2. Users without an IBMid can use the LinkedIn auto-fill option to enter their account information and create a new IBMid. 

3. Users who already have an IBMid can log in and register for the product-specific Try experience. 

<br></br>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="User needs to create an IBMid">

Users who do not have an existing IBMid are prompted to continue through the registration process, including the following steps:

- **Password creation:** In order to maintain platform and account security, stringent password requirements are enforced. The user is presented with these requirements in real time upon clicking into the field, which are automatically checked off as they are met.

- **Email validation:** A verifcation code is sent to the user’s email which must be entered in the email verification field to confirm the user's identity and ownership of their account.

- **Notice and choice acknowledgement:** The notice and choice widget is used to obtain consent to contact the user by email and/or phone.

## Multi-factor authentication enrollment

Multi-factor authentication requires users to complete an additional layer of identification beyond their username and password to enhance security. Users can choose from five verification options and can configure more than one.

Multi-factor authentication can be implemented for all products and Try experiences and is up to the discretion of product teams when to incorporate into the registration flow. If implemented, the multi-factor authentication enrollment page will appear as the final step of the registration flow.

### User encounters multi-factor authentication enrollment screen

The user is prompted to select at least one of the following multi-factor authentication methods to begin enrollment as part of their first time accessing a product. 

- IBM Security Verify app

- Third-party verification apps

- Built-in device sensor(s) (biometric)

- Physical security key

- Email verification.


### Selecting multi-factor authentication method
