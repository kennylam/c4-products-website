<PageDescription>

Software as a service (SaaS) is one of the software distribution models that makes our products available to the users over the internet. SaaS is driving all the growth in the software market and is expected to continue growing. Many IBM clients want to consume IBM products as SaaS on 3rd party clouds instead of legacy on-prem software.Â  In order to stay relevant and take advantage of the SaaS opportunity, IBM Software needs to transition to the SaaS delivery model.

The goal of the SaaS on Hyperscalers project, internally known as Project Apollo, is to make our SaaS solutions available not only on **IBM Cloud**, but also on **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud**.

## Why hyperscalers?
Hyperscaler infrastructure allows for the massive scalability and performance of content not possible through simpler cloud-based or big data computing. Many of our clients have chosen to run on a single hyperscaler for their enterprise to take advantage of discounts given by them. This also has the advantage of focusing their IT departments on a single SaaS provider.

Our IBM Software needs to be sold and run on the hyperscalers as well to be an attractive solution to their business needs.

## SaaS experience
To be competitive in the SaaS market, we need to provide exceptional SaaS experience. Design focuses on engaging the users throughout their ** discover-learn-try-buy ** journey.
