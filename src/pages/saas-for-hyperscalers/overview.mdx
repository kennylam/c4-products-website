<PageDescription>

Product led growth (PLG) is an IBM initiative which enables product teams to quickly and easily bring their software and SaaS offerings to market. Through the use of PLG design templates and patterns, IBM product offerings are published in a consistent, optimal way that facilitates the research-backed Discover, Learn, Try, and Buy customer experience. The PLG design strategy also makes trials, adoption, and continued marketing and sales of IBM products easy and self-fulfilling.

A key part of the PLG initiative is IBM SaaS offerings, subscription-based services which make products available to customers not only on IBM Cloud, but also on the **hyperscaler marketplaces** for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. PLG design has adapted the Discover, Learn, Try, and Buy flows for each of these hyperscaler customer paths, providing a seamless IBM product experience regardless of the entry point.

## Why hyperscalers?

Hyperscaler infrastructure allows for the massive scalability and performance of content not possible through simpler cloud-based or big data computing. Many of our clients have chosen to run on a single hyperscaler for their enterprise to take advantage of discounts given by them. This also has the advantage of focusing their IT departments on a single SaaS provider.

Our IBM Software needs to be sold and run on the hyperscalers as well to be an attractive solution to their business needs.

## SaaS experience

To be competitive in the SaaS market, we need to provide exceptional SaaS experience. Design focuses on engaging the users throughout their ** discover-learn-try-buy ** journey.

## MultiCloud SaaS Platform

A MultiCloud SaaS Platform (MCSP) has been built to support this strategy and to enable and accelerate the adoption of SaaS on multiple hyperscalers across the BUs. MCSP has the goal to enable Try and Buy routes for the respective hyperscaler marketplaces and to accelerate the onboarding of IBM products via a common framework. The first MCSP enablement has been accomplished for AWS and the AWS Marketplace. Work is underway to expand the support to other Hyperscalers, like Azure.

From an experience point of view, IBM products onboarding to MCSP for the SaaS journey will benefit from a series of consistent and already implemented SaaS digital journey flows and experience touch points.

Some flows worth highlighting are:

- Try and Buy sign up flows (including upgrades)
- Email notifications related to the SaaS subscription lifecycles and usage
- A centralized IBM SaaS Console for clients to manage their SaaS subscriptions
  - [IBM SaaS Console link](https://console.saas.ibm.com/) (uses IBM Id for login)
  - [IBM SaaS Console online docs link](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/1.0?topic=getting-started-saas-console)

Additionally, MCSP provides a set of best practices to promote consistency in the Discover/Learn experiences within those Marketplaces.

Lastly, MCSP has also identified a set of in-product patterns to promote consistency for some common user tasks relevant to SaaS, such as the use of a trial countdown banner.

The sections included here describe those user journeys and patterns and provide the supporting design assets, guidance and best practices identified to date.
