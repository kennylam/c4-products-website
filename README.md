We are a single site for PAL guidance, components, patterns, and resources across IBM Products

For instructions on contributing to this site, please visit our [contribution guidance](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/contributing/updating-this-site/overview)

This site is comprised of 3 different code repositories:
[Carbon for IBM Products](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal/)
[Cloud PAL](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/cloud-pal)
[Shared Left Navigation](https://github.ibm.com/cloud-integration-design/cdai-microsite-common)

To ensure that your issue or enhancement is addressed in a timely manner, try creating an issue in the repo that is associated with the page you'd like to change. 
Go the page you want to make the enhancement or create an issue for and look at the URL prefix. Does it include `CDAI-design/cloud-pal`? If so, this issue would be best delivered in the [Cloud PAL](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/cloud-pal) repo. If it includes `CDAI-design/pal/`, you can continue creating the issue here.

Creating a new page/guidance altogether? Once the content is approved and merged, create an issue for a new link in the side navigation in the [Shared Left Navigation](https://github.ibm.com/cloud-integration-design/cdai-microsite-common) repo.
