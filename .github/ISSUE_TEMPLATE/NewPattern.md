### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Define asset and explain the rationale
- [ ] Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
- [ ] Clarify whether it uses existing assets, new assets, or both
- [ ] Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other products
- [ ] Complete the [accessibility design review](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/review/) for Content, UX, and Visual design

This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you should expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in with suggestions.

We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you’re not able to complete all of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to help.

### Ownership

Would you like to take ownership of this asset or should the proposal be assigned to a workgroup of the Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG)?

- [ ] I will take ownership
- [ ] Please assign a DSAG workgroup

*Taking ownership doesn’t mean you’ll have to work on this asset alone. The first presentation at DSAG is a great opportunitiy to invite peers to join you.*

- [ ] Provide a [roadmap](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal/wiki/New-asset-guidelines#creating-a-roadmap) for scoping and planning work

### Asset documentation

We’ve created guidelines to help you prepare complete and comprehensive asset documentation. These guidelines and the required structure are included in [asset documentation template](https://github.ibm.com/CDAI-design/pal/wiki/New-asset-guidelines#writing-asset-documentation).
