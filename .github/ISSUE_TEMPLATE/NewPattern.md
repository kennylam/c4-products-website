**Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Define asset and explain the rationale
- [ ] Include mockups and/or prototypes of any fidelity
- [ ] Clarify whether it uses existing assets, new assets, or both
- [ ] Include competitive and comparative analysis, and any inspirations from other products
- [ ] This issue will be the staging ground for the pattern contribution, and you should expect the Carbon core team and the community to weigh in with suggestions.
- [ ] Outline user testing you have performed either external or internal to IBM

We encourage you to surface work in progress. If you’re not able to complete all of the parts yourself, someone in the community may be able to help.

**Ownership**
Would you like to take ownership of this asset or should the proposal be assigned to a workgroup of the Design System Adoption Guild (DSAG)?
- [ ] I will take ownership
- [ ] Please assign a DSAG workgroup

*Taking ownership doesn't mean you'll have to work on this asset alone. The first presentation at DSAG is a great opportunitiy to invite peers to join you.*

**How to write asset documentation**
We’ve created guidelines to help you prepare complete and comprehensive asset documentation. These guidelines and the required structure are included in the Markdown template below.

## Overview
This section answers the question: “What problem does this asset solve?”
- Define the use of your asset and what it does.
- Explain a user’s needs and how the asset meets those needs.
### Anatomy
Include an image with callouts explaining each part of the asset.
`Show asset in visual form`
### When to use
Include a short list describing situations where this asset could be applied.
For example, use this asset when:
- Situation 1
- Situation 2
### When not to use (optional)
If required, include a short explanation about when not to use this asset.
## The solution
This section explains the asset in detail. Use a combination of written explanations and visuals to tell the story.
### Behaviors, structure, and functionality
- Describe the elements, components, and content that make up the asset.
- Describe asset behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states and content.
- Show the asset in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to illustrate your guidance.
Different assets require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and hierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are telling. See our [production guidelines](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/wiki/Production-guidelines) for information about creating assets for the IBM Design System.
- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of components.
- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.
- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the asset's behavior.
Provide a [Sketch file](https://www.sketch.com/docs/getting-started/) with any symbols you've created in the development of this asset.
### Best practices
List out best practices and include any design considerations that help with
making choices.
- Do's
- Dont's
### Other use cases
If there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here with corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for using one solution over another.
## Accessibility
Evaluate your asset to ensure it meets [accessibility standards](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) and guidelines, and provide details of compliance.
For example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box to begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”
## Testing
Outline user testing you have performed either external or internal to IBM. Include what context/domain it was tested in and any parts which were not tested. 
## Related
Which components did you use when building this asset? Did you reference other assets? List them here.
If necessary, clarify any differences between this asset and related assets.
## References
Help designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way you implemented the asset. Include any research, citations, books or articles that you found helpful.
## Maintainers
List any contributors and those who will be maintaining this asset moving forward.  
## Feedback
