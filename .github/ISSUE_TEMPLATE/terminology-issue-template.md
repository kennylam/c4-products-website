## Term (or collection of related terms) needing investigation
- ?


### Reason this issue is being raised
- [ ] There is a new term that it would be good to define and provide usage guidance for, so that everyone uses it in a consistent way.
- [ ] Different terms are currently being used to refer to what is essentially the same thing. 
  - (In which case we may all need to standardize on one term to provide a consistent user experience.)
- [ ] The same term is currently being used in different contexts to refer to different things. 
  - (In which case we may need to define different terms for the different purposes to avoid user confusion.)
- [ ] A term being used is at odds with what is commonly used in the rest of the industry. 
  - (In which case there might be an argument for us updating the term we use.)
- [ ] Offering team wants to coordinate the right term (or terms) to use for a new concept they are introducing in the offering.
- [ ] Other terminology related issue. 
  - (Please explain below.)
